1 Great sound. love the volume control on the wire. great fit to almost any head size or shape. Overall a great purchase and I love their product
1 Besides the fact that iPod is a skinny little waste of time, let's also mock the fact that it plays about two formats: whatever Mac plays, and MP3.  Woohoo.   What a selection.Then, we have the iAudio.  It has perhaps a half inch thickness, at most, over the iPod for the standard battery model (20gb and 30gb anyway; 60gb is as thick as an XL), though it includes so much more bang for your buck, even if some of that bang is kind of useless.  But come on; an FM radio isn't iPod standard?  Almost every other portable HD player has that by now.  About the only thing iPod has over iAudio is movie quality, which is, admittedly, better.  But I'm fairly basic; I'm buying it for my music, not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen.  If I want to do that, I'll buy a portable DVD player. For pictures, unless they're ridiculously high quality, this suits just fine.  But it's not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players; it's the sound quality.Which.  Is.  Marvelous.   It consistantly beats iPod, it has BBE equalizer, and it not plays MP3 and AAC, but WMA, WAV, OOC, and FLAC.   *FLAC.*   And if you download Rockbox (which is something you'll have to research on your own, kids), you can create themes, boost your battery life, and augment your listening pleasure even further.The only drawbacks are the battery life if you don't use playlists, skip around a lot, or play high bitrate files (all of which are fixed rather well by Rockbox), and the subpack.   What is a subpack?   It's a fairly good idea done badly.  It's a piece of [...] plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player.  In it are the power jack, line-out (which has a bad bass roll-off problem, unfortunately) and line-in jack, and USB port.   The general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else, but it wasn't executed too well.  Buying a charger from [...].com solves the power jack and USB port problems nicely, and is recommended most highly.(And did I mention recording with the built-in mic is amazing?  You can get good quality concerts with this puppy.)Plus, it's black.  iPod comes standard white.  And the X5 is just better
1 I saw this at the store and hoping to get it in 3 months my other reciever caught on fire and was a 19 year old YAMAHA RX-900
1 This product worked very well, and was easy to hook up. For my use I had 3 video game systems using component video & optical audio, and the switching was very quick. I replaced separate manual switchers for toslink & component, and am happy with this product
1 This was the perfect TV for our needs:  It fits the space, is economical, has great picture size and quality, and lots of features.  It is a good blend of current digital and CRT technology.  Not an LCD and bulky as they come, but once in place it delivers a quality viewing experience.
1 It pairs quickly with laptops & bluetooth phones. Holds the gps module firmly and matches the look perfectly.The only gripe I have is it doesn't have an anti-slip surface so that I can throw it on the dashboard and not worry about it falling off.The battery lasts forever. I remember using it for 6 continous hors before switching off...mind you switching off because I had arrived at my destination
1 I love this product.  Unfortunately, I blew mine up in West Africa (my computer was not damaged), so when I returned I ordered another right away.  I wish that it were a little thinner, but I suppose you can't have everything....at least right now
1 I couldn't believe how great this CD case is! I had a ton of loose CD's all over the place because I didn't have any cases. With this I could hold them all with a ton of room to spare!
1 Bought these to use while doing my daily walks & mowing.  They work 100% better than the little "lipstick" antenna you get with the MyFi plus you don't have to use the earphones.  The only time I lose signal is if I'm really boxed in an area that doesn't face south.  It actually works in some areas inside my house.  The sound quality is good enough for a casual audiophile like me.  Besides, there ain't much in the way of other options.  This is my second pair because my first pair had the left channel crap out because of a broken wire after a year.  So I use them as an extra antenna in the kitchen when I want to use the FM tuner on the radio
1 Things that I like: (1) The option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable.  I was a skeptic about it before I purchased it, but really do like it.  Also, this is the first keyboard that I have used that allows for so many typing angles.  (2) The included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard.  Even if you don't have Windows Vista, you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs.  (3) The keyboard has no lag for me, whatsoever.  (4) I'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys, etc.  (5) This is a small change, but I'm using this setup on Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop.  The software replaced the large volume notifications (onscreen display showing volume level, mute, etc.) with a smaller more attractive style notification.  Me gusta.  (6) The curved keyboard is also comfortable.  It requires no time nor effort getting used to it.  (7) I haven't had any problems with the keyboard being "out of range."  (8) For the mouse, I'm switching from the Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 3.0, which is also made by Microsoft, to the Laser 6000 mouse included.  This new mouse is more comfortable. (not a huge difference, but noticeable.)  It is also lighter, and slides around with little effort.What I don't like:(1) The lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'Start' then 'Log off Windows.'  I would have liked the option to change the key to the Shut Down / Hibernate dialog instead.  I haven't found that option available, so far.(2) The keyboard is a little bit wider than others, but I don't find it to be a problem.  It's just different.  Having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width.Five Stars
1 I needed a replacement Receiver for a fairly modest home theater system. I wanted a bare bones 5.1 system (no 6.1, 7.1, 1kw audio power, satellite radio capable, etc.)  I only use the Receiver as an audio switch and let the TV handle video source selection.  Reviewers of the Sherwood RD-6500 liked the audio but thought the set-up a little confusing.  Being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me.  The price was certainly right, about the cheapest thing around (at [...]).  I bought the unit and have been completely satisfied.  I would have given it five stars but heck, nobody's perfect.  I had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality (full disclosure:  my ears are 79 years old).  The unit has one optical digital, one coax digital and several A/V inputs.  The remote lets you pick Video 1-3, CD, Tuner and Aux inputs.  You tell the system which audio source to use for each of these, one time and it remembers.  I liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present.  I was surprised to find how many premium HD movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in HD either.  I also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them.  On the negative side I, like other reviewers, bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub-woofer is required
1 I have used These Seagate Drives for almost 2 years now. They work nicely for editing movies, and I like the combo Firewire and USB2.0 interface. I trust these cheaper Seagate than the expensive LACIE (we bought a box full of lacie D2, they ALL fail in 6 months) or store brand drives. Hard drives are prone to failure. But Seagate has served my company well.using : Seagate 750GB, 500GB, 400GB. daisy chained....
1 Works great, looks great, no problems.  22" monitor for this price?  More than I expected!
1 I've held off reviewing this item until I actually got some alerts - and I got plenty of them over the weekend, so here it is....There seem to be a lot of complaints of this being hard to set-up - so many, that after having no problems setting it up myself, I'd worried I'd done something wrong.  Over the weekend, a number of thunderstorms & tornados rolled thorough my area - using the S.A.M.E alert system for my county - I received a notification for each warning.  I purchased this radio specifically for the S.A.M.E alert system, living in central Mississippi, we get tornado warnings all spring - I didn't want a 2am alarm for a tornado 3 counties north of me.  My one beef with the unit is the radio reception - even the included external antenna, it's spotty - ESPECIALLY the weather radio reception.  I'm not sure how far I am from the nearest weather radio transmitter, but living in the suburbs of Madison, I can't be too far.  If you're in a rural area, I'd definitely look into getting an external antenna (it has a port for a better external antenna than the telescoping antenna included)
1 Great product! Very pleased with my decision to get this over the 100 so I could replace my alarm clock. Set it up just for the counties near me and turned off all the alerts I was not interested in
1 I purchased a SanDisc 4 GB SDHC card for my camera. At the time it did not occur to me that neither my SanDisc Image Mate 6 in 1 nor my SIIG 18-in-1 Reader/Writer would not be able to read this new version of Secure Digital. Long story short-I called IOGear tech support and was assured that this reader would work although netiher their promotional materails nor their packaging indicates that it will. Bottom Line: It works and it was a very inexpensive ($10 at CompUSA) solution to my problem.
1 I got this yoke to use with Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Other people have said that the build quality is poor on this yoke, but what did you expect?  It's just a computer game controller, it's not meant to feel like an actual pilot's yoke.  If it were, it would probably be much, much more expensive!Yes, the plastic build makes it feel like just another joystick, but I've had it for almost a year and haven't had any problems with it.  Also, I rarely need to reconfigure it, so there's not an issue of "wandering" from the centre point.All in all, this yoke is fairly good and works well with Flight Simulator.  It certainly makes you feel a little bit more like you're a real pilot, but don't expect to feel any G-forces or anything else like that
1 This univeral DVD player comes packed very neatly in an Oppo cloth case and is very sleek.  The finish of the DVD player is excellent, however the remote is not up to snuff in this department.  This player can play PAL DVDs, it upconverts it to NTSC & 1080i.  It's loaded with features that you probably won't see on most DVD players out there.  The upconversion works well though I'm not sure the color handling is the best.  The audio controls in the setup are awesome.  People have complained about the disc tray being flimsy/cheap, but I think it's just fine.  It's very quick to load and play.  You may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you won't be able to control most of the features.  The HDMI cable that is included with the player is of good quality.  Probably worth around fifty bucks in the market.  Price to performance/features you can't beat this universal DVD player.  Buy one and you'll know
1 Can't say enough of this machine.  I view all DVD's in HiDef now and that is a BEAUTIFUL thin
1 I've had this for about a week, and it seems to be working very well. The "autoscan" feature is very nice since I seemed to forget to switch between "city" and "highway" with my older units.The voice prompts are very clear, and the automute keeps the annoying beeps to a comfortable level.I've had several radar detectors over the years, and this one certainly seems to be the best so far. It is also rated very highly in the amgazine articles I found
1 I have used these batteries in a variety of applications and find they perform very well. Can tell no difference in their performance vs the name brands
1 This is a direct comparision between the Linksys WUSBF54G and TrendNet 509UB.Both perform as expected when used as a standalone hot spot detector.Both perform as expected on Windows XP. Installation was quirky for both. After driver installation, inserting into USB slot it wasn't recognized at all. Fiddled around for awhile and it finally detected the device. Had to disable the notebook's builtin wireless before XP recognized the device.Client software does not detect a device under Windows Vista Ultimate RC2. I assume this will be true for Windows Vista RTM too. Inserting the device into a Windows Vista RC2 system often completely froze Windows Vista (had to hold down power button for complete reboot). Had to disable the notebook's builtin wireless before Vista recognized the device.Appears that the TrendNet and Linksys devices are so similar that they must be made by the same OEM or reference design. As expected, evaluation results are similar.1. Both devices seem to have same sensitivity, similar to notebook's internal wireless card.2. TrendNet device doesn't have Windows XP signed drivers so an extra click during install is requried. Also installing on new USB ports requires extra clicks.3. TrendNet device supports 801.11a whereas Linksys does not.4. TrendNet device sometimes crashes Vista Ultimate RC2.5. Neither device's software client works under Vista Ultimate RC2. This isn't a deal breaker for me as they both work under Vista Ultimate RC2 networking as a USB wireless key. You just lose the client software feature.6. The Linksys has a somewhat useful backlit LCD, TrendNet does not.7. Both devices work as standalone hotspot locators equal well.8. In hotspot mode, both devices show SSID, channel number, encryption mode, etc.Conclusion: For XP, I recommend the TrendNet so save the extra dollars. For Vista, I recommend the Linksys device as it never crashed Vista Ultimate RC2 whereas TrendNet device was gave occasional freezes
1 I am so grateful to all the reviewers of this product for convincing me to give it a try.  I have a six-year old Hitachi DVD player, and I lost the remote.  I couldn't play anything without it, because the buttons on the player don't allow me to select any tracks.  The instructions on this remote are incredibly easy.  It found my TV automatically, because it's set for a Sony TV by default.  When I had to locate a code for my DVD player, I got worried-- none of the 3 Hitachi DVD codes listed in the manual worked during the setup process.  But there's a search function to use in that situation, which allows you to scroll through all the codes in the chip's library till one works.  It found one within seconds, and I was up and running.  I think I'm going to buy this as a holiday gift for my siblings so they can get rid of all the remotes scattered around their living rooms
1 This is simply the best remote you will ever need for all your infarad remotes!  I have a Chinese satallite receiver that I could never get it to work with all other "universal" remotes.  I was able to teach this remote to work with it!  This is a small computer
1 I almost bought a new phone because it was not working. The ability to purchase this battery saved me some bucks
1 This is a great TV.  Bought after looking around for months.  Receive HDTV signals, about a dozen without cable box.  The number will continue to rise, but all of the main shows and programs are in HD.  Especially for sports fans almost every broadcast is in HD.  True you will only get about 720P resolution from the broadcast over the air currently, but when the Blue-ray HD movies are out in larger number and at a more reasonable price, this will become the standard.  And this TV has 2 HDMI ports so you are ready to go.  I have had another CRT sharp which I have liked, and this product is no different.  Picture is amazing.  Some analog channels dont look that great, but I am at the point where where I would rather watch whatever is on an HD channel.  Note:  I am in what is considered an upgraded cable section.  The TV has the tuner to receive HD without the box as I have said, but I can't speak to sections that are not "upgraded", so you may want to look into that.  Nice to receive without paying for extra equipment. 
1 If you're considering the ViaMichelin (under $200 GPS), you're probably trying to decide if a GPS that is more than $100 cheaper (much more than $100 in some cases) than its competitors is really any good. Honestly, I would have been skeptical too, however, a relative bought one of these units, and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before I decided to purchase one myself.My brief summary is that Yes, this unit is a good GPS and a great value. After using mine on a trip, I'd have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine.Background: my GPS experience is limited to a 7-year old Garmin III Plus. I had to plan detailed trips on my PC using Mapsource, then upload the waypoints and routes to the GPS. It could be a time consuming process, and because the unit wasn't necessarily user friendly, my wife never learned how to use it.Enter the ViaMichelin. We just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit. Set-up time for the trip was about a minute - all I had to do was program in the street address of our destination.Now for the rundown.First - what it doesn't do well.a) Using it for the past two weeks (as a test only) around my home town, I was a little disappointed.  It never sent me the wrong way, but it didn't always take the best route.  Some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area; and in some cases old "logging" roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built; and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route. Although this was disconcerting at first, I don't think it is a big deal as you'll see later.b) Macro-directions - i.e. for a several hundred mile trip. It will get you there, and if you're taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns, this would be a good device if you aren't familiar with the route. But my route this weekend was very simple. Get to the interstate and drive. It didn't pick my preferred route to the interstate, and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four-lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate. (Although it did recover and finally suggest my route as I stubbornly drove "my way.") So, for a major trip, I'd recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route.  Use this device if you have a lot of mind-numbing turn-by-turn.Now, what it does well:a) voice prompts are great. It doesn't matter that it doesn't say the street names. Turn right in 300 feet is good enough - especially with the map that you can glance at.b) It did great around my destination towns of Charlotte, NC; Gastonia, NC, and Rock Hill, SC.  Did it take the best route as I drove from soccer fields, to hotels, to restaurants?  I don't know since I wasn't familiar with the areas, but the routes seems to be just fine, they got me exactly where I needed to go, and I never had to look at a road map.  And after all, this was the main reason I needed a newer GPS. It passed this with flying colors.c) My wife did some of the set-up while in the car. She'll be using this one on her on very soon.d) We wanted to find a particular restaurant, but didn't have the street address. The restaurant was in the Points of Interest database, and it took us right to it. Also, finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great.I also found a feature that was not listed in the 89-page manual.  From the navigation map, if you touch the screen, it has a "bypass route" option. It will give you some distant options (1 mi, 5 mi, etc.) then it will find a bypass route for you. So, if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam, this will route you off the interstate, take you up the road and bring you back on.  Obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving, but then it's going to try to turn you around and/or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer.  The bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out.In the future, I would like to do a side-by-side comparison w/ a more expensive (borrowed) GPS. Also, after more experience, I'd like to update this review.Bottom line: I am glad I bought this unit. I cannot imagine spending $100-$500 more on a more expensive model. Though the higher priced models may have better features, the value for the extra money just isn't there for me
1 One of the few of these type of items available on the market. I bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews. I had received some free drives from Newegg (Seagate) and needed to house them. This was a no brainer set up. The utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off. (XP pro SP2). The firmware was one rev prior so I updated it - absolutely smooth as silk. Reformatted the drives. I chose the RAID 1 option and ext3 format. I like the fact that you can specify RAID size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume. The drive is fairly solid. The fan is not very noisy. The front slide up access door is a little kludgy. Good user interface. I was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen RAID and ext3. The only thing I can never get to work and it is 100% MY lack of knowledge is the email alerts. I couldn't get Infrant to do it and same with this one.As an aside I love Amazon and NewEgg. Great retailers both of them
1 Had mine for over half a year now, and after outstanding abuse it performs as well as the day I bought it.  I fill it and empty it every month, rarely ever defragging it, back up my PC files and play movies right off it on my laptop.  Throw it in my backpack, plug and unplug it all day(hotswaping), still with rarely a sign of slowdown, and it barely gets from cool to warm ever(even when its running from inside my backpack).For some reason requires two usb ports on my new PC (high speed USB2.0 ports) when it shouldn't.  It runs on one port at school just fine and I have switched the y cable with a regular usb cable with 50% success.I'd buy another one of these in a heartbeat if I ever thought the one I have would run itself out.  The fact that it doesn't need an external AC adapter to run on my USB1.1 laptop ports(though it does have a hole for a non-included AC adapter)is a blessing.  I've even used its double usb cord to run my power hog of an external cd-rom drive(my cd-rom AC doesnt work on both sadly).  Might be luck of the draw, HD related items seem to be sometimes, and I've yet to have to try out their customer service.  But overall worth every cent spent(especially since I was looking at a 4GB external for $40 before I saw this). Nearly $1 a gig is a great deal.
1 This notebook case is a perfect fit for the MacBook, and it is compact enough to fit into larger bags.  It is exactly what I was looking for
1 This was a perfect fit for my 13" Macbook. Tried a couple cheaper ones, but was never satisfied, usually they were just a bad fit. This is by far the best, holds the computer in place and is light weight. It's true you get what you pay for. One complaint, the extra pocket in front could be larger
1 I originally bought this CD case for my car, because I listen to CDs the most while driving.  This was not a good case to bring back and forth at all.  It is very large and heavy (even without CDs!), and the long zipper-tail makes it hard to open with one hand.  I now use it to house computer software and playstation/gamecube games.  For what you pay, it is an excellent buy
1 seems pretty good.  doesnt come with any directions on how to transfer files from your "C" drive into it
1 This is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot.  It is also silent and convenient.  It is more flexible with the FAT 32 format it comes in but I preferred the NTFS file format whice is safer and more stable.  It was no problem to reformat to NTFS
1 This was exactly what I needed & it is very easy to use.  It does a great job of encrypting your data, if that is what you want.  There is plenty of space and it is snap to use with my Mac Powerbook.  I recommend it
1 This product is fantastic. Great sound with a small footprint. I purchased a JBL On Stage at first and it malfunctioned after only a few days. The CTA product has been great and it cost a lot less than the JBL product
1 I got the Griffin iTrip to enjoy my iPod in my car, and then I HAD to get a Belkin TuneBase for iPod mini! With the short battery life that is further aggravated when using the iTrip, the TuneBase keeps my iPod charged so that I don't have to plug it into my computer's USB port every night after work
1 I'm very pleased with my Iriver.  I have tons of room to store all my favorite songs and even sermons!  I do a lot of driving and I listen to it all the time
1 This is my second iRiver product. The first one was fine but it couldn't survive a trip through the washing machine. This one works well, is easy to navigate through, good sound. The case is rather cheap. The other one was rigid plastic. This case is hard to use and makes it difficult to change the batteries. The software leaves something to be desired so I use Windows Explorer to add songs and rearrange the order. All in all, this is a great little mp3 player
1 I use this on my MacBook. Works flawlessly to hookup a TV via svideo. OSX handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that I use when i have it hooked up. Plug it in and video switches to tv settings, unplug it and its back to normal. I use this with dual view mode so that my desktop stays the same always on the macbook, and i just get extra desktop space when I plug the tv in.The quality is quite suprising for s-video, very good.100% must have for anyone that has a nice tv :
1 It works fine, but it gets really annoying when you're using it with a widescreen Mac and a widescreen TV. The zoom function most plasmas and LCD TVs have is 16:9 aspect ratio, whereas Macs are at 16:10 aspect ratio, so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you're trying to display, or have massive letter-boxing. After three months, I still haven't had any glitches that were this adapter's fault.If you have HDMI or DVI on your TV or projector, don't bother with this. Go straight to DVI with a Mini-dvi to DVI adapter, then get a DVI to DVI cord or a DVI to HDMI cord
1 Ya tengo una semana con el y lo recomiendo ampliamente La imagen y la nitidez de este monitor son sobresalientes Con una resolucion de 1680 x 1050 las fotos tomadas con mi camara digital se ven como una imagen real Tiene varios ajustes segun el uso que le quieras dar Viene en español
1 I bought this part and the addition that makes it a double shelf. I have my TV on it and it's great
1 Yes, it plays videos (DivX + Windows Media tested so far).Yes, it plays and sorts your photos.Yes, it plays MP3s and sorts them by their ID3 tags (artist/genre/album/etc.).Yes, it comes with a good TV audio/video out cable (letting you use the Zen like a high-def digital video player).Yes, you can download your CompactFlash card directly onto the Zen hard drive.Yes, it syncs with your Outlook tasks and calendar.  Wha?  Yeah.  It's hidden in there too.  Along with an MP3 alarm clock.If you're going on vacation with a digital camera anytime soon, this is the multi-tool for you.  Leave the laptop at home.  The Zen has plenty of battery life and plenty of room for music, movies and photos to keep you moving for days when you're unwired from the office
1 ...I have been using this drive for a few months now and have no complaints.  One of my laptops only has a USB 1.x port and it is incredibly slower for backups.  That has no reflection on this product, but be ready for things to work slowly unless you have USB 2.x and don't blame it on this drive.  :
1 This product is perfect for anyone who has a thumb drive but no lanyard or other item already attached to it.  I could not find anything like this at any of the big stores i.e. Circuit City, HH Gregg, etc.  I hopped online and found this right away...thanks
1 I love the Sling Media Slingbox Tuner!  The install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews.  The quality of picture is just as good as on my Cable TV.  I have a great processor with the highest internet speed I could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color I get with it and may also be the reason I have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time. Plue my shipment from Amazon was in 2 days!  You rock Amazon!
1 I am very pleased with the Brother P-Tough QL-500.  The printing lables are a good price for the quantity you get. 
1 I BOUGHT THIS LIKE A IPOD BUT ITS BETTER I HAVE ABOUT 20 MOVIES ON IT AND ABOUT 500 SONGS AND SOME PHOTO'S AND STILL HAVE 50 GIGS LEFT. THE ONLY HANG UP IS YOU STILL HAVE TO GO PAY ANOTHER 20.00 TO GET THE PLUG-IN DOWNLOAD THAT LETS YOU SHOW MOST OF THE MOVIES. THEY SAY IT CAN DO ALL THIS STUFF BUT NOT WITH OUT DOWNLOADS AND SOME ADD ON'S ONCE YOU GET ALL THAT THERE ARE HOURS OF FUN TO BE HAD.
1 Excellent product - very ergonomic, easy to set up and use! Wireless works great.I would recommend this product
1 I like to a lot this product, and I work very well and also has a low price, to obtain this is a good offer for who buys it
1 So far this seems to be an extremely effective (and inexpensive) way to store pictures captured with a multi-mega pixel digital camera. The sevice provided by this company shipping-wise was very fast. All-in-all a great deal
1 After all the hype on-line about the T-amp, I had to check it out for myself.  All the reports are true!  This is one hot little audio amp which can not be touched for the price.  If you have a portable audio device and two speakers you need to drive with it - this amp is for you.  You will not be disappointed.  I recommend purchasing the AC power supply as well.  You can find others cheaper, but the recommended one works perfectly and insures the warrantee for the T-amp remains valid
1 Great sound form small box.Nice platform for tweaking.Good power needed
1 Ha sido una buena compra, es un procesador rapido y efeciente en las tareas multimedia
1 I purchased this as an extra phone so I could access both phone lines on the second floor of my house. Well-built with hold and 3-way conferencing features, sound quality is good and it has selectable ring levels for each line. Powered from the phone line, no external power is used. One drawback: the line indicator doesn't light when the line is being used by other phones in the house.
1 After reading several reviews of this product I was skeptical about buying this cable.  I wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my PS2 but I was not sure about paying the price for these when the Sony cables are about half the cost of the Monster Cables.  The reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the PS2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the TV almost discouraged me from even buying this product.  I decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my PS2.  I am very happy that I decided to buy these cables.  The cable connector fits perfectly into my PS2, better than the connector on my original Sony cables even.  The connectors fit nicely onto my TV, they are snug but not too tight.  I believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my TV because of the 8-cut turbine connector, which fits better than a standard RCA plug.  The video and audio from my PS2 is unbelievable.  My PS2 pushes the video signal to my 32" LCD HD TV at 480i with these cables.  With my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry.  Now the graphics are crisp and clear and I only wish I would have bought these sooner.  The display from my PS2 and games fits nicely onto my TV in widescreen now too, before the picture was not centered on my TV and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen.  I would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their PS2 over the stock Sony cables.  There are other Monster Cable versions for the PS2 available so choose the one that is right for you, but if you want something that is moderately priced, don't need digital audio via fiber, and the next best thing to HDMI than this is the cable for you.  I am going to get the Monster component cables for my PS3 next so I will be able to hook it up when I don't have HDMI available for it to use.One more thought, be sure to change the video output on your PS2 from RGB to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr in the system configuration before hooking up your PS2 with these cables or it may not work.  My TV told me the connection was not supported and I did not have video output until I changed the video output setting on my PS2
1 I wanted something to use while mowing the lawn without emptying my bank account.  Cuts the lawnmower noise to a tolerable level, and the sound quality is decent.  Headphones are comfortable and adjust easily.  Unit collapses down to a more manageable size for transportation.  Good battery life
1 Yep everything is very cool...clarity...etc..but they should do something about clipping in the head of laptop..it is just dancing while I keep it on laptop.
1 Recently bought this receiver to replace a dead one.  There isn't really anything special about this receiver, but it a solid one.  The two year warranty tells me they stand by their product, in case of a problem (hopefully I won't need to use the warranty).  It gives good, clean power and sound.  Don't let the 75W/channel fool you.  This is a high current receiver and it has a good amount of power.  Time will tell, however, how well this receiver performs.  Also, for the price Amazon was selling for, I couldn't pass it up.
1      Unit installed in seconds with no false starts or headaches of any kind. The base is wide and heavy and when placed on a mouse pad doesn't move around at all, even when I get a little too "into" my flight sim games. One can't beat the price either. For flying prop planes, I am very saisfied with the performance
1 First time I've ever written a review.  I'm not a high tech type, and sometimes it's nothing but frustration for me to deal with high tech stuff.  This remote was a breeze to program, and works fantastic.  My wife and daughter are even less high tech and love it.  Any problems with use, just press "help" and the remote with ask you questions and correct the problem.  Highly recommended
1 I bought this CD player to use in my car and it has worked beautifully!  When you consider what a fine CD player it is, and the incredibly low price, it is most certainly a Best Buy!
1 Plenty of room for my Creative Zen Nano player, ear buds and spare battery. I only wish for something other than BLACK! It is easy to misplace
1 Works as advertised and works really well. I purchased it to provide a serial port for a Virtual windows machine running inside Mac OS X. I used to have issues with other products, but not this one.
1 This cartridge is very light, easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality, durable black ink on the page. It is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that's great! (It even comes with an expiration date!) HP also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit. One thing that I didn't like, however, is that the ink can go quickly. If you print a lot, you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so. My needs are about 20 pages per week and I have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks. That's not good; although to be fair to this HP ink cartridge I am printing graphics. Four stars (well, maybe three and one half stars) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge. It loses points for not lasting longer.
1 Needed the adapter to charge my Shuffle, since the AC adapter I have is one of those older Apple ones with the Firewire connector. Suits my needs perfectly.No experience with any sound docks, however, so I can't comment on the performance flaws other people have brought up
1 Great headphones for running! They fit my ears perfectly and I don't have to worry about foam anymore.
1 Plugged right in and worked like a charm. No software to configure. Great buy. Great product
1 Portable, easy to use with any chip and really nice pix. I love being able to print from digital files on my ipod
1 I've been struggling with heat issues for quite some time with my gaming PC and have gone through numerous fans and combinations trying to find a way to keep it cool.  I had just about resigned myself to just running with the case open all the time until I bought this.  After shuffling my PCI cards around so as to allow a space between this and my 6800 Ultra I fired the machine up (and closed the case! ;-) and did some gaming, all the while keeping an eye on the temperature of the card.  This fan easily dropped the temperature on the card 5-7 degrees celsius when the graphics are running full bore.. once the chaos on the screen starts to subside, the cooling is even better.  As an added bonus, this will cool the card down quick once you exit your game.  I thought for sure that I would have to trade off cooling for a lot more noise and I was surprised to find that I had to listen for it in order to hear it.  About the only complaint I have on this is that the fan speed is manual with a slider on the back (which I knew when I bought it) so it is not temperature sensitive.  Still deserves 5 stars though
1 Just purchased earbuds at target.  Excellent sound quality, expected that much due to a previous of full headphones.  Even better once you find the right adjustable tip to fit your ear.  Well worth my 100 dollars, granted, I've only had them 5 to 10 minutes, but I won't be returning them any time soon
1 Bought it for my wife and she loves it. It keeps track of where you were and restarts from there. The display is small (no fancy menus like Ipod)but works well. Sound is excellent.Be sure to install the drivers and software. The software is small, simple and EASY to use - or you can just COPY/PASTE files onto it.If you DON'T install the drivers it only works at USB 1.1 speeds and takes a LOT longer to load songs. With drivers you get full 2.0 speeds
1 I've never had a problem with these DVDs.  They burn and play perfectly and I've never had a problem printing on them.  What's particularly nice about these is the printable area goes all the way to the hole.  It doesn't sound like a big deal but it makes for nicer looking DVDs.  By the way, I use an Epson Stylus Photo R300 to print great photos and DVDs
1 This Bluetooth remote device works as advertized with my Apple notebook.  Be sure to insert the Bluetooth card all the way into the printer slot before you begin.  I thought mine was in far enough at first, but it really wasn't.  One caveat:  I was hoping that the Bluetooth signal would be strong enough to enable printing from the next room, but it's not.  Also new users should know that they can set up their computer to handle both Bluetooth and cable at the same time
1 Works well for my mac and BT enabled Sony Ericsson phone.  Other than the built in drivers for the printer in Mac OSX, support for options within the card and printer are non-existant.  Still cant figure out how to manually force a realignment of the cartridges..
1 Length of ownership: 8 weeksThis puppy really reaches out. My laptop's internal intel/pro wireless sees about 6 networks but with the Hawking dish a typical haul is 20 networks. Thanks to some friendly neighbors I've said goodbye to my paid isp and now enjoy casual and free internet connections, and until metrofi completes its set up of free city-wide wifi I'll get by with that thanks to this neat Hawking device.Unless I need the next and more expensive step up for such wifi booster devices I hope the Hawking dish proves durable..after all it's been just 2 months of ownership so far, albeit good ones.Note: For me this device has not seemed very directional in that it will pick up off-beam signals fairly well. Also, placement by a window will help your reception
1 I purchased the Hawking HWU8DD on the recommendation of several other RVers. WiFi signals at RV parks tend to be unreliable. Until now, the built-in antenna on my laptop could "see" the signal at my park but could not access it. As soon as I installed the software and connected the Hawking antenna via USB port, I immediately accessed my campground's signal.  The Hawking antenna has solved a major problem for me.
1 These were double the price on another site! My little girl LOVES these speakers! She is using them with her pc.my ONLY complaint and it's my complaint and not my lil girl's...is that the sound quality is poor.  Obviously, not the speakers to get for real sound quality...but kids love them
1 My doctor recommended getting a wrist support when using my computer because I had previous carpal tunnel surgery.Ilove the way it comforts the wrist.The gel inside is different than other gel pads I had in the past.It really does give great support and comfort.It can prevent future problems for your wrist.Iam glad Amazon carries it
1 This product with the assoicated software (included) is everything you hope it is but really don't believe it will be.  The x-ray glasses you saw advertized in the back of the comic book when you were a kid cost you $1.50 to learn a lesson why you should be skeptical.  The Garmin is the real deal.  I bought it for my son (a high school state (Indiana)level miler).  When he took off for his first workout and got home an hour later, he uploaded his entire workout onto the computer and low and behold his whole course with speeds, times, street names, etc., showed up on our computer, starting with the satallite photograph of our patio!!!! 
1 I just made a long trip from Miami, Florida, all the way to S. Carolina, with a Explorist XL loaded with DirectRoute V3, everything worked just fine, I installed the software, unlock It, upload the maps, all with out any problems, the unit was very fast and accuracy didn't need to keep it over the dashboard, from inside the vehicle worked very well, never took more than a minute to track all satellites, the street route where very accurate, never  got lost, working with POI's was very simple, didn't have any problem handling very large maps I really recommend this unit
1 I gave my mother-in-law my old Color SporTrack so she could start Geocaching.  I was in search of a handheld unit with a bigger brighter screen.  This unit is it. Although it is large, it has features I like: AA batteries (19 hours?, we'll see), easy menu navigation, USB connection to a PC and a rugged case.I am an engineer so am kind of picky about user interfaces, etc.  I have sent in a list of problems I have found with the menu navigation. All of them can be worked around, but it doesn't work the way I think they intended.  It will be interesting to see if Magellan gets back to me and eventually provides a new version of FW (I am using 1.05).After doing a lot of research about Megllan SW (mostly negative), I decided to go ahead and purchase the Mapsend DirectRoute v.3 DVD. I found it acceptable and have had no real problems using it. One nit, the files it creates are very small.  You need to edit a text file in the Magellan directoy to allow it to save and download larger files. But once you get the maps downloaded to your unit (very straight forward), the menus change to indicate turning direction.  Thus, it is getting closer to a crossover unit.  Interestingly, Magellan will offer a new unit called the "Crossover" (available January 2007). The specs are pretty sparse on the Magellan web page
1 Does the job nicely. I am not an audiophile so I dont get into the nit picking when it comes to speaker wire. Just tell me what gauge to use and I do it. Seemed high quality to me
1 This bag is very good.  The outside phone jack is a plus.  The only negative - hard to access the other DVD's when in use
1 Arrived on time and is perfect for using headphones and speakers at the same time.
1 I also purchased this product because of the quality of the receiver made by Sony. This 7.1 channel Home Theater with HDMI passthrough is a great machine that money can buy. If you are looking for quality, surround sound in your livingroom, or your own Home Theater, this s the product you should invest in. This is a great investment for me. I am glad I found it in Amazon
1 The Lexar JumpDrive Lightning 2GB flash drive has very impressive performance ratings of 160X (24MB/sec) sustained Read and 120X (18MB/sec) sustained Write speed capability.  This is one of the very few USB drives that lists the Read/Write speed capabilities.The "reality" of flash drives is that the smaller the file size, the slower the transfer rate will be.I ran some tests with the Lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes:* 433MB	 784 medium files, avg. 550KB	12X	4 min. 3 sec. * 483MB   81 large files, avg. 6MB      54X	59 seconds * 1GB	   1 very large file           115X	58 secondsSo, even though the Write speed capability of the Lightning is 120X, the transfer rate drops to 12X with medium size files, which is fairly "real-world" usage.  But, don't let that dissuade you from considering the Lightning:  The higher the "speed capability" of the device, the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files. To prove this point, I took one of my "great deal" CF cards (that had no speed ratings) that tops out at 36X Read / 7X Write, and ran two of the same tests: * 433MB	784 medium files   3X	15 min. 10 sec. * 483MB	 81 large files    7X	 7 min. 48 sec.So, compared to the Lightning, the "great deal!" card took nearly 4 times longer to Write the medium files and 8 times longer to Write the large files.  So, which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over...Whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a USB flash drive, if the performance numbers are not specified, BEWARE!  What you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing.  I know, I have several in my drawer.So, my bottom-line advice is:  Look for the highest-rated device you can find.  Flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow!  So "future-proof" your purchase by shopping for a high-rated and large capacity for now and the future.(I have no relationship with Lexar or the Flash memory industry.
1 This is a solid device, and I like the included software for burningb dvd as well as c
1 I haven't had any problems using this DVD/CD burner over Firewire on a G4 iMac running Mac OSX Tiger. In fact, setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual; it was truly plug-and-play.Minor quibbles: the open/close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended, the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case, and only the Lite version of Toast 6 is included.Bottom line: I would buy this burner again, given my experiences using it
1 The product works great. What i didn't like was not having the attachment to charge the battery in my home. It only came with the cigarette lighter power source. I had to purchase the other power source seperately. I also had purchased the 3000 model previously and it came with both power sources. Why is that
1 the cam is good...it has a special feature to show the person/object by automatic adjustment...and a very good part abt it is, it has a built in mike and helps a lot..
1 Bought these stands after much research, was looking for a good stand at a fair price. These serve the purpose. Great stand , great price.
1 I bought this SD card and took some 100 snaps out of it.The card is really fast with my canon A510 camera.Reading takes a slightly longer time than writing.I would recommend this card to anyone.Actually this card outperforms the 16MB MMC supplied with the camera.Also the 256MB card will hold upto 200 (may be lesser) 3.2MP pictures.
1 I purchased this card a month ago. I use it on my Dell Axim X3i. So far it has been fully compatible, fast, and flawless. I haven't owned another PDA or SD card so I can't give you a first-hand benchmark. But I can say that accessing the card is quick and I have not had any skips while playing my music files. The 256MB is good for the price if you wait for Amazon to drop their price in conjunction with the manufacturer's rebate
1 I got my replacement battery and put into the computer.  The date started working whenever the computer is off and I haven't had any problems
1 the Klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long. I researched dockable ipod / mp3 players for a few months before I decided on this one for my wife's office. I'm fussy when it comes to quality audio equipment, the I-grove does not disappoint. It provides room filling sound with no distorion. I listened to it extensively before wrapping it up for xmas to make sure it had the quality I insist on. It delivered.Another bonus with the Klipsch is it's ability to accomodate other mp3 players and / or personal compact disc players.I'm completely satisfied with my purchase of the Klipsch i-Groove.
1 I'm sure these earphones work and sound fine but I was looking for something softer/smaller for my apparently small earholes.  :
1 I bought one for a relative last Christmas. Saw how convenient and easy it was to program. So I bought one for myself this March. It works just great.The setup software programs the 670 easily and the Logitech remote replaces the remotes for a HDTV, a DVD Home Theater A/V Receiver, a DishHD DVR Receiver, and a Psyclone PSC01 Source Selector.  One button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity. I like the color screens and icons on the higher end  Logitech remotes .. but the discrete placement of buttons on the 670 is much more practical for me to use. Function wins forms this time round.All is not rosy though. Added the Sony PS3 to the   entertainment arena.  The Bluetooth requirements of the PS3 leaves it out of the IR RF remotes inner circle. Consider this  if you need a combined solution for Infra Red  RF as well as Bluetooth devices. ( The Sony PS3 is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case). Fully backlit is a signifcant bonus..none of the replaced remotes had adequate backlit features. Short version: This cool tool really works and should satisfy most. Think "out of the box" though if you have a Sony PS3 tied into your entertainment network. ..click
1 My wife and I have maybe a dozen or so devices connected via WiFi spread throughout our four-bedroom home. Among these were an Avaya 4610SW SIP (VOIP) phone and a PC serving as an Asterisk server (Asterisk is an open source PBX). This configuration has worked well for a couple of years now. In the past few months I've been having occasional disconnects of VOIP calls coming in to Asterisk from the PSTN. After some investigation, I decided to move my phone and server off WiFi and onto a HomePlug network, using the electrical wiring as another Ethernet. The hardest part of the installation was freeing up an electrical outlet in my second-floor office where my phone is, in the basement where the server is, and in the family room on the first floor where the LinkSys WiFi router/access point is located. After that, it was just a matter of plugging in an Ethernet cable from the Netgear box to the router, and moving the Ethernet cables from the WiFi boxes for the phone and server to the Netgear boxes. It was that simple.[...]I wish all high-tech equipment were this easy to install
1 I purchased this for my teenager to use with her IPod Nano. I shopped around for a while before I finally decided on this one because it came with losts of accesories and she uses it everyday all the time and says it works perfectly. I've only had it for a month but it's holding up in the hands to a teen and no complaints so far.
1 We love the card scanner, it's the best. Everyone who is a recruiter should have one it saves time and space
1 I have, and have had, lots of SW radios including a number of Sonys.  This is one of their many gems.  Great perfomance, lots of memories and snazzy look. Good for travel (certainly not as compact as the SW100, of course).  A great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio, and don't want to spend very much. Good for listening, and good for DXing while traveling.  Look no further
1 Good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device.  My major fear was that this would make my 1955 too thick and I would not use it.  It is just right and great protection for my 1955 - by the way I replaced a 4150 with this 1955 and case because my daughter accidently sat on my 4150 and broke the screen.  It is a great piece of protection
1 I bought this phone and three expansion handsets about a year ago and couldn't be happier.  The phones have the clarity of a corded phone.  The built in intercom system is perfect.  The phones allow you to "name" the handsets as we did (Kitchen, Basement, Bedroom, etc) so you can page based on location rather than remembering numbers.  They have a reliable and effective speakerphone built in, as well as jacks for headset (though the speakerphone seems to make this unnecessary.One problem with these phones is the batteries.  In the year that we have had them, the battery life on all of the phones has degraded severely.  Often my wife would be on conference calls for one to two hours, and we would go through all four phones.  Leave a phone off the charger and in a day it's useless.  The only solution was to replace the batteries (which was significantly cheaper and easier than buying new phones and re-programming all the phone numbers).  I recommend the Energizer ER-P240, which is a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery and won't develop the Ni-Cad memory effect.I love that the base station has a place for 4 AAA batteries so that the system can still be used during a power outage
1 What can I say, it's an ink cartridge. You get a lot of pages out of it, its great quality, and thats about it
1 I can't describe this MP3 with words "great"It's more than great.It fits my pocket, and it's music quality is great.My sister and I bought this incredible MP3 with doubts but, it is more than great.If somebody is considering buying an MP3, I strongly recommend to buy this iRiver.Thank you, thank you, thank you
1 These speakers can almost hit any range of sound, but if anything they are a little weak on the bass side.  They put out very crisp sound for my system.  You might want to add a sub to them for complete range sound
1 If you're looking at this page you probably already know a lot about HP calculators.  Chances are you either had a 32SII and don't want to go the Ebay route or wanna slim down from that 48/49 series because you don't really need that extra functionality.  Is the 33S perfect?  No, not by a long ways, but it's the best thing we've got.  If you want a new scientific RPN calculator this is it.  
1 This battery will transform your Epson PictureMate Deluxe Viewer Edition from a nifty little photo printer into an absolute Must Have item ! I take it with me when ever I'm doing an off-site photo shoot, or even when I'm out for a weekend shooting candids. The portability you get by adding this battery to the printer is priceless. I have printed as many as 40 photos on one charge.
1 Not so many words to talk about this item, but let me tell you that now I always use my rino turned on, in my car. baterie drain its no more cash pain!**Good things:-comes with a led(small light) that turns on with diferent colors(red green yellow) so you could know if your rino its turned on or of or disconected.-large cable(for a car, you could use youre rino in the back seat even conected in the front of the car)**bad thingsjust a bad ending quality, it looks like a adapter of 2.99bucks, but I had owned it for more than a year and cero problems.pvpaco@gmail.co
1 I have had this item for about 6 weeks.  Haven't used to a lot, but so far I like it.  This power inverter is smaller and looks nicer than my old one, which was stolen out of my car along with a few other things.It has one electrical outlet, and above that is a cigarette lighter outlet, so if you have other devices that need that kind outlet you can use them while this power inverter is plugged in.  The plug fits kind of loosely in my cigarette lighter outlet, but I don't know if that's the plug or the outlet on my car.  The only thing I don't like about this item is the "no tangle" cord.  Its one of those coiled up cords, like a telephone cord (look at the picture of the item).  The cord is long enough that it could stretch to the backseat, but if I were to try this it would pull the plug out of the outlet.  Its coiled so tight that I couldn't really put it anywhere that would require the coil to be stretched.  It just annoys me that they call it a 36" cord.  For practical use not more than probably 18", but I don't have the item right in front of me to measure it.I'll still give this item 5 stars.  4.5 if Amazon allowed 1/2 stars. 
1 How often are you on the way to work or to a meeting and you end up getting stuck in the traffic jam of the century. Nobody is moving and you can tell it's going to be a while. It would make sense to brush up on those reports or your presentation while you're stuck, but who wants to eat up the battery on their laptop right before a presentation? This inverter allows you to plug in your laptop into your car - just like a wall outlet - no worries, work off your car's alternator instead of your battery and catch all your typos before you get to your appointment
1 It was up and running in 15 minutes. Had to order WiFi adapter to get program updates - got it and it installed automatically. I would buy it again
1 This might be the best thing Apple has ever made, it works perfectly with my Mac Book Pro and my PCs. The security is awsome and it has great range with easy instalation. After many flaws with my Lynksys, I took the risk with this and it was worth it. I have NEVER had a problem with this
1 Seems sturdy, however, it did not fit my TV. Will not fit Samsung LNS 4692D
1 I bought this for my new Sony Ericson W300i phone so that i could actually put some music on the phone. It came with a MS pro adapter which is nice because I have a slot on my computer for that. It is fast and just what I wanted
1 This thing is selling in the Best Buy with $53.33 + tax. I bought that in here for under $40 with free super saver shipping in Jan. It's working very well until now with my SonyEricsson K800i
1 Which was Nomadland.  The Bono-pod is beautiful.  However the inconsistency of the iPod itself is a nightmare.  I've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs.  It's apparently a known problem with several models of the device, with no particular fix.  Great. 
1 This is an exact replacement for the high quality, precision made suction cup mount that comes packaged with the Nuvi unit. Unlike many such suction cup products, this one sticks. I bought an extra for ease in "cross-decking" my one Nuvi unit between my two cars. I just leave the mounts in place on the windshields of both cars and move the Nuvi and power cord to whichever car I am using at the moment. A good convenience. Note that I attach this mount to the windshield. I have not tried the red-disc mounting plate that allows the mount to be attached to a pebbly-textured dashboard... I was scared off by the warning that ones you attach the red disk it is extremely hard to remove.
1 This has been an excellent purchase.  Well worth the price. Excellent color and clarity
1 It was great that the Nikon D8 purchase included a SanDisk MicroMate with USB connection
1 As of 2007 most of the bugs mentioned in the other reviews are fixed. The ipod fits snug as a bug in my unit and it even charges it.Youu can even find this as low as $140 or chaper.  Im not sure why the bad reviews.This is a wonderful dvd player and the newer one i got even plays your ipod through your tv if you want..older versions did not allow this. You should buy this.The video quality isnt great, but good,  thats why i gave it four stars instead of five It is bulky but you need room for the ipod to plug in. the only bad side is no ipod naviation from the menu. you must use the ipod itself..But being able to play your ipod and dvd through any tv with rca jacks (audio/video) is great..i can now backup my purchased ipod items to dvd since i have an eyetv250 which allows you to use your computer as a tv. the eyetv has rca jacks on the device which allows me to record it to my harddrive which i then use toast to burn my dvd..all in all its completely worth it. even as a stand alone dvd player it's great..never had the first proble
1 This router functions great in the household environment.  It is VERY easy to install and security is equally as easy to set.
1 This keyboard is the best i've ever used. The backlight is excellent and the keys just have that unique touch that just soothes your fingers. Great and cool design. i recommend this keyboard all the way! Im typing on it right now by the way.
1 What can I say, I got a code at Chrismas time through the Amazon promotion and got this tv for $200. It's perfect for a master bedroom set and the picture is great. Why spend so much more than the regular Amazon price for a more expensive brand when you can get this tv? No problems and it works wonderfully! Great deal, with free shipping even! Time and again, Amazon is great
1 I purchase this on Amazon for $499 no tax & free shipping. You can not match this quality at this price. The HD with HDMI cable using Comcast digital box is outstanding. The sound is also better with the HDMI vs componet cables. The jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode. The picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color. I looked at Samsung for $800 and I am glad I saved myself $300 with this LCD
1 I use an i-Pod mini in my car.  It is in the center console where it connects to the auxillary input.  I used to have to open the console to make changes or turn it on or off.  The air click allows me to do all of that with the remote that I leave in a tray outside the console.  It works just as it is supposed to with no problems at all.  It solved my problem and I am a very satisfied customer. 
1 I have my iPod hooked up to the stereo on my motorcycle. The iPod stays tucked away in a safe place, and the remote gets strapped to the handlebar. All the needed functions are now at my fingertips. I can lock the iPod control pad, so it doesn't accidentally get bumped.I also use the Griffin FM transmitter. Nice, but not nearly as slick as the remote. I can't use them both at the same time, but I don't need to
1 This one of those products your girlfriend wonders why you are wasting your money on, that turns out to make life so much easier.  It has allowed me to leave my ipod in my backpack on my way to work, and go through security to get into work, all without having to open my bag.  The remote has a velcro strap that I use to attach to the shoulder strap of my back pack.  I am able to start and stop tunes and change the volume without needing to pull the ipod out.  My only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap.  As the device is made for active people it would be nice to know that everything would stay connected, because when things do come undone, you do have to open your bag and put it all back together and that defeats the point of having the air click.
1 This was a great buy, Item was as described. A++++++++++
1 The item works as I expected. I received within the tiem offered by the seller. I'll buy again from this merchant
1 After having my GPS come loose (barrel pin failure) on more than one occasion I decided to give this a try. I've now used this on a 2 month MTB tour of Nepal and Tibet. Held my Forerunner 301 securely on hundreds of miles of washboard, technical singletrack, etc. Also withstood countless grabby children and curious bystanders in numerous villages. You do NOT have to remove the wrist band to use it with the mount. I love the reassuring "snap" when it locks into the mount, and the wrist strap functions as a safety back up - although it never came loose from the mount on me. Convenient release allows you to remove it quickly and easily. My only very minor complaint is you have to remove the GPS from the mount to charge it.It fit perfectly on my 1" (25.6mm) diameter bars.Like it so much I just ordered the "oversize" mount for my motorcycle.
1 Very good product. You do need to use help menue for instructions because the paperwork that comes with it doesn't tell you a lot.Overall I'm having fun using this product
1 I bought this in lieu of the Fuji counterpart which was out of stock in Amazon. Since the Fuji Finepix E900 runs on AA batteries and its AC powercord/supply is an option one has to buy, this reader is a cheap, quick and even more portable alternative for downloading pix to my Mac
1 I'd been using wireless for gaming for the past 3 months and always had lag problems even if the latency said it was around 50. I got the set of these and they work awesome. Just plug one into an outlet next to your pc and one next to your router. Run the cat5 cables from one to the pc and one to the router and you are all set. Now I can do my gaming without the lag I got from wireless and have yet to have any problem with these. These are truly plug and play. Now if only they were a little cheaper
1 I purchased the LJ3390 to replace an existing LJ3320.  The $350 rebate available until the end of Oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase.My main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer.  Duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the LJ3390 over the LJ3052.I now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully.  All run XP SP2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection.  Software installation went flawlessly.While I can't comment about HP versus other vendor software, I can say that the LJ3390 software is a major improvement over that of my LJ3320.  Scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2X, quite likely more like 3-4X.  Printing of complex pages is also much faster, exactly what I would expect from a newer generation print engine and an HP Laserjet printer.All in all I am very pleased that I upgraded.  It has met all my upgrade goals.  Printing is faster, scanning is much faster.  The network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on.  I haven't played with the fax side yet, but am hoping this finally let's me retire my trusty standalone fax machine.
1 MVSV3 Gives excellent color with a vivirant and vivid feel.     Deffinently a high porformence wire in its class,and worth the buy
1 This unit is battery powered and mine arrived with a dead battery, however, replacing that was quick and easy although irritating. After installation and use for a while, I noticed the unit also got rid of some direct dialed calls as well as computer generated calls. If you don't speak immediately after pickup, the telemarketer hears the tone and hangs up! Great Item..
1 I bought the Telezapper from John Whitaker and it was delivered in 3ays. It didn't work so I contacted John and he told me to return it and he would test and if it didn't work he would send me a new one . He was good to his word and promptly send sent one that worked. He's the best:)Ben. Rodrigue
1 Works as it should. It's enough for my needs and handles simultaneous activity on all ports well. Not an unbearable dropoff in performance while say, transferring huge files to an external hard drive, while burning a DVD, and fiddling with the iPod. If you're like me and you need your laptop to do a little more without adding to desk clutter uneccesarily, this should suit you fine
1 This product is simple to use and has all of the functionality I need while presenting
1 Got 3 of them a few months ago, and buying another one now.  Excellent product, fits many different plug types. No flaws.
1 I agree with Max.  Don't use those inferior cables that come with your DVD player.  I just bought a DVD player and immediately got these Monster cables to connect between the TV and DVD.  Image quality is the best I can get on my 20&quot; TV, really cool
1 I received this product from an Amazon.com seller for 1/2 the price of what Best Buy was selling it for. It was new and in an unopened box. Upon opening the box I was able to tell right away that it was built very good.  The hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere.  I had spent over $300 for a Runco antenna for my Runco projector for local HD (DirecTV does not have local HD in my area) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80% reception with it.  This antenna with a similar design the the Runco model is built better and I get between 94-98% reception depending on the channel (directional antenna so reception varies slightly).  I was also amazed with the fact that I not only get local channels for Youngstown Ohio, but I also get locals with over 60% reception from Cleveland (direction antenna is facing) but also Pittsburgh (which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing).  Great product and no issues with it so far.  The included booster works better than the one built into my DirecTV receiver, so I advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector (if it has a built in HD tuner) or TV for best results
1 I've had mine for 10 months now and it's been very reliable; not one problem with it. It's quick to print out the first page, the display is a monochrome LCD with a backlight so you can see in dark spaces (say, if you keep it under a counter), no paper jams, no nonsense. Also, if you're an Apple owner the drivers are already included with OS X; truly plug n print. What's a real treat is to combine it with an Apple Airport Express and use Apple's Bonjour software to easily convert it to a wireless network printer. Bonjour is available for both OS X and Windows computers, and is a breeze to install. I highly recommend if you're in the market for a multifuntion monochrome laser printer machine that is compatible with both Windows and Mac OS
1 I bought this for my daughters Sansa e230 mp3 player and could not be more satisfied. I was leary of the price, but this unit is worth every penny. Recharges your player and has awesome sound for the size, while plugged in or with batteries. No regrets about this purchase
1 The reception is much better than my old antenna, however, I was expecting instructions to be included with the antenna.  After some time I figured out how to hook up the tv and vcr to the antenna
1 I am quiet satisfied with the T10. 3 cons: no reset button, AA battery type (I prefer litium ion) , primitive menu.3 Pros: mp3 + voice record + fm radiogood sound qualitybelt clipOverall success: 80 %
1 I owned a Bose wave radio for a number of  years. The price was well beyond my financial means, but I made the sacrifice, and I'm very glad I did. The sound defied belief, and  I was very pleased. You will be, too. Forget the detractors herein. They know nothing, like the "reviewer" who listened to AM Radio. If the sound of frying eggs is appealing to you, then, any radio will suffice. But if a clear sound is what you're going for, then go buy a Bose Wave Radio! You'll be glad you did. I know that I am
1 Bought this to convert PAL Hi-8 (Canon) purchased years ago in Singapore for Mac (PowerBook G4, Tiger OS-X) nonlinear editing. Worked perfectly the first time, only needed to set a single switch to select PAL. No need for software drivers etc. Happily plugged and played with the Mac and the camcorder.Acceptable price for the features and ease of use.
1 Installation time was only about 20 min. Hook up the Digital and analog cables, and it configures itself. It took me a while to decide which resolution to use that was best for me, but once I found it, I was really pleased with the size and clarity. Music composition is much easier with the big screen. One small con was the stand is not adjustable, but it fit perfectly into my office space, so I didn't need the adjustment. The video quality on this LCD is amazing.Ronnie Be
1 After enduring the so-so performance of my stock ipod headphones, I figured it was time to step up.  As I travel constantly, I wanted something that would would block out exterior noise; as a music freak I wanted something that would sound great.  After countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get (UE vs. Shure vs. Etymotics) I bought the Super.fi 5 pros.  In the end it was the price, Amazon was selling then for $90 less than the MSRP. Can't beat that.As soon as they were delivered I hooked them up and put them on.  They aren't kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down.  I keep the volume on my ipod way down, a fraction of what I kept it at with the stock headphones.  The room I was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open, so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement.  With the UEs on, it was just me and the music.  A fire engine thundered by, normally a painfully annoying experience.  Again, the UEs reduced it to the point that I didn't realize the fire engine was coming until I saw it drive by.As for the music.  I first played a couple of tracks by Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins.  I immediately noticed elements to the music I never even heard with my other headphones.  Jenny Lewis' angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like I was listening to them for the first time.  Next I put on some Ray Charles.  With the UEs, it was like I was there in the front row.  The horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while I discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section.  I've read complaints that in ear headphones don't produce enough bass, so I decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from Siamese Twin by The Smashing Pumpkins.  While I'm not by any means a bass head, I need some bass to enjoy rock albums.  I couldn't have been happier with how the UEs performed.  The drums in the album (which I've always considered some of the best) came alive.  The guitars actually had some balls, but didn't overpower the singing or drums.As is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time, your ears are bound to hurt a little.  I found this to be the case only for a day or two, after that the UEs fit snugly without any complaint.  The only weird thing I encountered had to do with ear wax.  My wife, an audiologist, forbids the family from using Q-tips.  So after taking the UEs off for the first couple of times, there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones.  Like the discomfort, this earwax experience only lasted for the first couple of times I used the UEs, and with the supplied earwax cleaner it was really a non issue.When there are so many excellent products out there, finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging.  I've never tried on Shures or Etymotics, so I can't compare the performance of those headphones and the UEs.  What I do know is that I got a really great deal on the best headphones I've ever had.  Without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones I will buy for some time. 
1 After looking at $250.00 mounts, I was unsure about order at this low price.  This is a great, well built unit. I would have no problem puttinga 130 lb. unit on it if you follow the enclosed instructions.  Hardware for most walls included.  Well painted with no rough edges.  Mine was installed over wall board into wood studs.  I used the awl to make sure I hit the studs dead center. Delivery from New York to Sarasota, Fl. was 5 days.  Can't bet that
1 Basically, This backpack is all that I need in a back pack. Very well padded, very roomy, fits an HP Pavillion dv8000 17" laptop. Its very attractive and after a month on use shows no signs of ware and tear. Definately worth the $. Unlike my previous packpacks The straps adjust so quickly and easily that I adjust them every time I put the pack on or take it off. Great Product!!!
1 I purchased the docking station for potability when on the beach, at the pool or camping.I had it going nonstop for 8.5 hours on the same set of batteries it was still going strong.I would by again
1 this is good for when you go on a trip you know it will keep your streetpilot going. and it isn't bulky. and it's made with quality just like the streetpilot itself
1 It's a decent mic for just a few bucks.  It works adequately, and has an on/off switch, and an XLR connector.It comes with a XLR-to-1/4 cord.  If you're going to plug this mic into a mixer, be sure to get a XLR-to-XLR cord.  The volume of the mic, when connected to a mono 1/4 jack with the included cable, was almost inaudible.  With a XLR-to-XLR cord, it was at normal volume levels compared with other equipment
1 La instalación del producto fue bastante simple, la configuracion y operacion tambien los son, solo he observado un problema con el control remoto, en ocasiones deja de funcionar, no controla el volumen ni cambia los caneles de cable, solo despues de oprimir el boton de apagado y luego de vilver a activarlo es que regresa la funcionalidad de los botones de control de volumen y selector de canales; otra observacion en el funcionamiento es que al seleccionar en forma progresiva canales estos saltan al siguiente
1 Never a better caluclator in existance.Used it all thought Calculus classes and Computer Science. It does everything. Fast, smooth, pretty print flawlessly and more memory then a herd of elephants. Even does 3D graphing excellently. Spherical trig? not a problem at all and fully graph it, slice it up and zoom in.Also a few sites on hacking the TI-92 Plus that you can google for anyone intrested
1 Great buy for the money. four stars only because it is made out of about 3/8" mdf and could be sterdier. Height is great for medium size bookshelf speaker tweaters to be at ear level while siting on the couch
1 Use Canon ink with you Canon printer and you'll have no problems, just excellent pictures
1 Very good quality sound, loud ring, substantial weight (not all cheap plastic with no heft).  Only con is that even on "low" the ringer is very loud
1 This is an AWESOME little device. Let me start with the pros: 1) EASY: Incredibly easy setup (literally press one button - never believed it, but it's true. Plug in the usb transmitter, press the blue button & voila.) 2) GOOD SOUND: For a small set of speakers, these things sound great. They are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system, but sound very good and comparable to a $45 two-speaker set of monitor-side speakers. There's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well. 3) WIRELESS RANGE: With 4 AA batteries, you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house. Reception is great. I am used to bluetooth headsets that don't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - I had doubts about bluetooth speakers, but I am amazed with reception these guys have. 4) CONTROLS: the Forward, Reverse & Pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both Media Player or Yahoo Music Engine running on the laptop(the only two I tried). Again, I was surprised, but they worked flawlessly. 5) COOL: As far as cool factor, this little guy is definitely that. Cons: 1) NO REMOTE: It would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound, FF, RW, Pause, Play controls. 2) NO CONTROL FROM PC: You can't control the sound (or mute) from the laptop - only from the speakers. 3) SOUND: Above I said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system. However, these are small speakers and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too. It's good, but it's not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system. There is base but not a great deal - you definitely won't feel the music with these speakers. 4) VOLUME: Volume is limited - it's enough to fill a mid-sized room, but not much more. For $100, this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with NO WIRES. Carry it to your kid's room. To the garage. To the basement. No wires, nothing. If convenience is and portability is important to you, and if medium sound quality is ok, then I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker system. It's great. Personally, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them because I would really like fuller sound (this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room) and more base - but they're so cool and convenient, that I doubt I'll be able to give them up! FOR OTHER BLUETOOTH IDEAS AND WI-FI NETWORK OPTIONS, see my post at the Hydrogen Audio forum: [...]
1 I bought this for my wife. I have an iRiver HP120, which I consider to be one of the best ever made. I have to say, I think this is a great little player. The interface is well designed, the unit is well made, and the sound quality is excellent. I purchased a U2 about 1 year ago as a gift, which was also excellent. I think Cowon is making some of the better MP3 players on the market now, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality unit
1 The parallel USB adapter worked just like it was supposed to. My problem was that the printer I was using it with was no longer supported in Windows XP. So while the adapter turned out to be useless, I'm keeping it for possible future use
1 I ordered this product and it arrived 2 days later. It is genuine Canon ink for a great price. I will definitely buy at amazon.com again
1 I've had Canon printers using this cartridge for more than a year and won't settle for any of those knock-offs. Yeah, they're often much cheaper, but this is one area where you get what you pay for. Brand X fades and does not perform as well in the inkjet system. This has been confirmed in independent lab tests in a leading PC magazine. I have had to install and remove countless cartridges and NEVER spilled a drop. The pop-in, pop-out design couldn't be easier
1 I've owned and use the Sony 256MB Memory Stick Pro pictured (in black), and currently also use a 1GB Sony Memory Stick Pro. I've not had any problems with them, formatting or otherwise, over long periods of heavy use. OK, a little pricier than, say, SD cards, but a good quality product for Sony digital cameras.
1 I have really bad luck with head sets (I dropped a vise on my last set, really)these are really well built headphones, it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad, but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set. They can get very loud and not crack, exceptional base, and mic is very very clear. They are light but feel solid, although I have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong. I have very big ears that is one of the reasons I bought this head set, it is very comfortable. The only thing I don't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups, but maybe it help keep your ears cool, maybe. I really give them 4 1/2 stars. I paid about $90 for them and I have no regrets. So if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the Sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they don't have mics but good headphones.Hope this helped, good luck
1 The quality of this bag is just great the problem could be the very tiny front bag. It also has a small bag for the AC power cable and transformer but once you use it there is no place to put it comfortably considering a 15" laptop
1 This armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen (stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector). It works well for jogging and working out. The neoprene (better than leather for sweaty workouts) armband fits well on my upper arm (6' 200lb) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms. It is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place. I first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so I now just clip it in which seems to work fine. It has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but I think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband. I have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and I am satisfied at this point, I am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included. Also on another note, apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors I have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception. The button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly. All in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it's a solid value.
1 I bought these for my Zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding, compact headphone for work and working out at the gym.If you are like me and can't stand all the earbuds out there, then you need to find another solution. I tried the Premium Zune buds at 40 bucks, and the Bose Quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks, but they just gave me earaches and I was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight. I read countless reviews of this headphone and I can say this is the best sounding under $40 headphone out there that won't mess with your hair. (Yes, better than even the Bose earbuds!)If you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player, be prepared to be blown away. Tight, full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids. You don't have to crank them either, they sound rich even at lower volumes. But if you do crank them they don't distort at all. If you have ever tried the Bose Quiet comforts at the stores, these sound very similar but with an open air design!The only negative is the comfort. The little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so. I think I'll get used to it. I'd much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs. jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal (which I had). That could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems.Some other reviewers complained about the headband, but it sounds like they were not wearing these right. Once on your noggin, the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head. This keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort. I do not think the headband is too tight, it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place.I might buy a pair of the PX 100's as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading.  The PX 100 is the same exact phone in an "over the head" design. At $40, I can afford to get both
1 When my CDs started skipping I thought they has seen the last days of spinning, however this Disc Cleaner has solved all problems. You simply put the CD into the cleaner with the label side down. Then, you spray the disc cleaner to the disc surface. You only apply one even spray of cleaner. Then, you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed. Once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times, you can remove the disc and let it dry completely. Most of the cleaner was absorbed into the cleaning pad after the recommended 5 rotations. I found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick. The first time I used this cleaner I was a bit frustrated with it because I noticed little pieces of black foam all over my CDs. Apparently, there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down, but once I removed that piece of foam, all was go. This unit comes with one additional cleaning pad. I think if you are just using this to remove fingerprints, you won't have to replace the cleaning pads very often. Handy gadget to prolong disc life and restore performance to contaminated disc surfaces. ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
1 I purchased 2 for my son and husband. Both rumble and work perfectly with the racing games such as Need for Speed Underground 2, Nascar 2003 and 2004. Some of the early games cannot be used, but they still love it. The wheels actually feel like you are in a race car with realistic resistance. I recommend this item
1 It works!  The antenna isnt junk either, I am getting almost all the digital stations from chicago 25 miles from sears tower with it inside my house sitting on my desk. I also get many digital channels that happen to be on the comcast analog cable in my area (chicagoland). Problem is that all the analog stations on my comcast cable are untuneable, so I cant watch those on my mac.  Its not supposed to be a cable tuning box, just digital stuff, so its fine, I just thought it did that as well.next thing to do is get a bigger/better antenna mounted outside and cancel cable (as I only watch a couple stations anyways).eyetv - works.cytv with it - works great!  make sure you go and donate to that opensource project
1 Very easy to assemble, has very classic lines, lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation, hard to find add-on shelf in maple. Holds a lot of equipment
1 The Apple Airport Card - network adapter - Airport 802.11b was a fabulous purchase.  It did exactly what it was supposed to, was easy to install and test, worked immediately.  The vendor that supplied the airport card was prompt, efficient, courteous, and careful in the packaging.  Very happy with the product
1 This card is great for the seamless apple look and feel (and only option for internal in imac/ibook/PB) but it is way overpriced now that it is out of production. There are other options. Belkin F5D6050 USB B adapter has drivers for 9.2 and OSX, several manufacturers (e.g. certain Belkin, Linksys, Microsoft) PCI cards have airport extreme chipsets (broadcom) on them that OSX reads as a real airport Xtreme card. You need to do your research and some cards have different chipsets in different revisions, but it is pretty easy overall - and you can save $100
1 I had been using my air conditioning vents to hold my XM radio and this was recommended to me through a friend.  It's super easy to install and works great.  It doesn't move or shake while driving and is adjustable height wise to fit most car setups.  It was well worth the money and in the summer heat, I am glad I bought it and got my extra air conditioning vent back
1 Nothing much to report.  They were as advertised and fulfilled my need
1 The thing that seperates this DVD Case from the rest is it's center lock design. It's secures the disc nicely without damaging it... like I have had others do. Worth the extra dough to have a quality product. (Now if only their memorex's software was as good!
1 I purchased this USB light/fan combo mainly for the fan.  I'm one of those guys who is a human heater -- always a little warmer than everyone else.  I use this fan when I'm studying in the library, on the computer at a coffee shop or even at home using my laptop at the desk.  It provides a nice little jet of air right at my face which makes me feel cooler all over.  I can even direct it right in front of me and only the nose of the rotor head is visible because when the fan is running, of course, you can see right through the blades.  The fan runs quietly too.  I've had a couple of times when the fan is making a bit of a noise or isn't running a quickly as normal.  I just pop off the rotor head, adjust the blades a bit (they are flexible vinyl and I give them a little twist and a crease to make them more rigid as they sometimes get bent in my carrying case), pop the rotor head back on and it's good as new again.  While I like this product a lot, I doubt with frequent use that it will last much more than a year but I still think it's well worth it.  My only regret is that I didn't order two or three of these for future back-ups if needed.  The light works well too.  It does not illuminate the entire keyboard but in a dark setting it does provide enough illumination for the typical user (a hunt and peck typist may be frustrated but I think it may be enough light for that kind of visibility as well) and definitely enough light to read from a book or hard copy document.
1 I travel overseas a lot for my job. This little power strip is compact and enables you to keep ONE adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your "normal" plugs for operating four devices. Most Monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money (wires, cables, etc.) but this gizmo rocks
1 The tapes are exactly what I had searched the web for.  Thanks to Amaxon.com for listing the seler
1 The Sony STR-DG600 7.1 has worked as expected and is a high-quality system at a great price
1 I used to buy those cheap $[...] red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets, just to have some fun, but the batteries didn't last long enough and the beam wasn't bright at all, not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round.  I bought this one thinking that it would be really cool because it was green.  I thought the high price tag was pushing it just for a little green dot, but it is much more than I thought it would be.  The beam is clearly visible in the dark and you can even see the dot on the blackest street in the middle of a sunny day.  The range is incredible and makes street signs reflect hreen shimmers!  I love it!  A much better buy than those crappy red ones, and the AAA batteries are easy to replace and last much longer
1 These ear buds provide a VERY good fit.  They block out a lot of external noise.  Much better than my previous ear buds.  The sound is clear with good bass.  Definitely worth the price
1 We used this remote to program a Sony AV-RM3000 remote, but we need more flexibility for our HTPC.  In hindsight, we should have bought a stand-alone IR unit and something like the Girder software.  Or, maybe just an IR wireless keyboard.This is not a remote for those seeking flexibility, or those who like to customize their media experience.  This is an excellent remote for those who want out-of-the-box usability, and don't want to bother with customization.  It's well-built, and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for.Pros:  Comfortable shape, sensible layout, high-quality feel, reasonably compatible with many programsCons:  Doesn't do absolutely everything in every compatible application, only four somewhat-programmable keys with limited option
1 This Salamander Designs rack is very well made and looks great.  It takes a few hours to assemble, but the result is nicer than most home theater furniture out there.  Unfortunately, Amazon's shipping (via UPS) didn't go so well and the outer box arrived in very bad shape.  I was hoping that the inner box would protect the item, but, alas, one of the two doors was damaged.  I'm now trying to get Amazon to replace the door, but they can only exchange the whole unit.  The shipping box is completely destroyed, so I've been forced to contact the manufacturer directly.  Crossing my fingers..
1 This TV/Monitor rocks!!  I've been looking for a combo computer monitor and TV that I could use in my office. This LCD does both very well. I'm writing this review with the LNS4696D installed and everything on the screen is very large (what I wanted) even at 1600x1200 and the resolution is far better than I expected!! (hint: sharpen the image and set high energy saving mode)
1 Also at an awesome price. I am going to buy another one just to keep in case the one I have needs to be replaced
1 Are they the best no.. Do they impress people who havent hear them before YES!! To me thats the best compliment, they are much more objective listenerswith no preconcived notions. All I ever hear is " Those speakers sound so Good" " I love those cool little speakers" etc. I've played everything from Bach to Dio and they sound very realistic. Subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level. At [...] they are a steal.. I paid [...]in 1991 and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new.
1 Outstanding product!  Keeps the laptop cool plus the added benefit of having 4 USB ports
1 I bought this cooling fan because my computer was shutting off on its own, and the problem seemed to be that the computer was overheating.  While this product hasn't "cured" my computer, the performance of my computer has definitely improved with the use of the cooling fan.  The extra USB ports are convenient as well.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a laptop and wants to keep it from overheating
1 I am new to this type of device, but it has performed as expected
1 This is a great radio for sailboats and other boats that do not have a 12v power supply
1 I bought this because I needed good phones without the extra bulk.  They're really lightweight, but not flimsy.  They have very good sound quality.  I really like the volume control on the headphones themselves. It gives me the extra level of control.  All in all, a really good bang for your buck
1 Jensen JM10 Anonymous Review I love these headphones!! The easy access volume control is right where I need it and I can turn it ON and OFF whenever I need to. They are a great value! The headphones stay where they are supposed to and fit my head great. The sound quality is clear and crisp. The single cord attached makes it feel as if your not wearing headphones at all. I would recommend it to all my friends
1 This card worked out of the box on my Linux, Ubuntu 6.10 based system. This Belkin card--at least the version I have-- is based on the Atheros chip set
1 After reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my IPOD. I had read a lot about how it interefered with the USB cable or the hold switch.  But I couldn't argue with the price.I must say that this product it actualy one of the best aftermarket IPOD products I have puchased.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, Protect My Ipod. I have no trouble opperating any of the IPOD's  buttons and I simply remove the case when I charge the unit.  I have not found that it impairs the functionality of the IPOD at all while keeping it securely around my neck.  It is perfect for Jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites.  I find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion.Ultimately it perfectly protects my IPOD when I am out and about which is what it was designed to do.The reasons I gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little. and I whished they had mounted the IPOD right side up like they did on the nano model.Over all I am well please
1 For the price, these speakers are well worth the cost. Of course, in my opinion, anything that dosnt say "Creative" on it is usually worth the price. Not a lot of bass, but with the bass boost, these speakers sound real nice. Only bad thing I'll say is that M-Audio's tech department is really bad. Emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for Vista, still no answer. (my inquiry was about a different m-audio product)
1 The six commonly used power tips provide flexibility with this product.  I purchased this to use as an interface between a CD Walkman player and the AC power cord.  The heads have specific polarity; so it is possible to attach the heads incorrectly.  However, if you pay attention to the plus and minus hookups as indicated, it's not too difficult to make the attachment correctly the first time.  I found the product to work effectively.  The only negative I can see is that the actual plug-in device is a bit bulky; so if you want to use this in a power strip setting, the AH3WH can be a bit of a plug hog.  However, other than that limitation, the product was reliable.  Recommended to save on those batteries which do add up
1 I have been putting this television through its paces since I got it a few weeks ago, and it is by far the best TV I have ever owned, and very difficult to beat.  The image quality is really good, with bright, vivid colors and wonderful detail, especially for 1080i/p content, but even lower-resolution 720p content, which is what's more commonly-available on OTA HD broadcast, looks phenomenal.  I also have an Apple TV hooked up to it, and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p, 480p, or 720p, it still looks quite good.It does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection, and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost, and the DNIe processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse.  However, it's very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have.Like all LCDs it does have some slight black point problems; these aren't noticeable for fullscreen 16:9 content, but for older 4:3 content it's pretty obvious that the black isn't pure black.  However, this is again tunable.The only thing I really notice which is pretty annoying is that it doesn't do a very good job of upscaling 480i content, such as the output from most video game systems, and for DVDs to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive-scan player there is a lot of visible pixelation when the 480p content is scaled up.  It's really more a sad reflection on how the previous "next-generation" video looks downright primitive by today's standards.The other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners, it doesn't have an on-screen program guide.  My previous TV (also a Samsung) had an on-screen program guide, but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on, and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the EPG information anyway, so it's not really that big of a deal.  You can still see the detailed information for the program that's currently showing, so it makes use of EPG, just not as much as it could.This television's tuner is also quite phenomenal.  My previous TV required a very carefully-positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation, while with this one I only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and I get perfect reception of every local digital station.Another nice improvement over Samsung's older HDTVs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that TV stations do (for example, pillboxing a letterboxed 16:9 show, which is very common for widescreen non-HD programming).  Also, analog TV stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital, so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo (while previous Samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material).As a PC monitor this is also quite nice.  I have a Mac mini hooked up via SVGA cable, and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal-clear, and of course you can hook it up via HDMI (with a DVI to HDMI adaptor) as well.  The only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint - at least on analog SVGA the only 16:9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080, which can be difficult for some older systems to handle.  However, on HDMI it should support all the standard HD resolutions.This television may be more expensive than others in its size class, but it also far outshines every other TV I have seen, aside from the newer LN-T4065, which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio.  If you want to only buy one TV which will last for a long time, it would be hard to go wrong with this one
1 NOTE: this product will only work on walls with wood studs.  No metal studs.See the sanus website for installation manual and more details
1 The carry case does the job of holding my Walkman and therefore I say it is worth the money.  However I have found for my smaller arm it is hard to get it wrapped around in a steady position, but with some effort it does.  Overall I am happy with the purchase
1 I just added this to my Onkyo HTIB system and it's made all the difference in the world. I'm a bit of an audiophile (on a reasonable budget), with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10" Polk in my truck. I'm most satisfied with the Polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess. I listen to a lot of music with double-bass drumming and thought that this PSW12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10" sub I like so much. Not the case. What I get is very quick bass with that ground-shaking impact that I always look for.I'm still going easy on 'er for the break-in period, but I can say that the trailer for Kingdom of Heaven (included on the Blu-Ray disc) sounds absolutely stunning. Paired with my 57" Sony HDTV, trips to the movie theater are few and far between these days. Now is a great time to pick up one of these, since the price seems to have recently dropped by about $50 throughout the web.Unbeatable sub for the money!
1 I use this subwoofer to augment my 7.1 system. It was easy to install, gives excellent response, and I couldn't be more pleased.
1 The only thing I don't like about it, is the scanning area is upside down where most scanners you open the lid and put your photo or document close to you this scanner you have to put it all the way to the back of the scanner so you have to open the lid all the way. Also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use. I did like the way XP found this scanner right away with no disks or software. I have a cannon scanner I just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with XP with out cannons software, The cannon was so bad that I purchased this one all in all I like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers
1 I liked options and text edit. I really liked the ability to scan into Micsoft Word
1 This is one of the best products I have spent my money on. This speakers 'speak' well and you will be amazed at how well they sound for that kind of size.Also, the buying experience from Amazon was excellent. I got mine deleivered in about 2 days.Will recommend product for anyone else
1 You can count on every Monster Cable made. It's worth the extra money over the cheap ones. The gauge of the wire is thicker and the ends are made of better material
1 I'm a fanatic for duplexing since I move a LOT of paper around, sometimes amounts which I have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds.  The Brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well, maybe even the best.  This particular machine has wireless G built-in, but it costs over $100 more than the same machine without wireless, and for well over $100, you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper, maybe even better, and for my office, wireless is inappropriate.  (It also should be stated that if you go outside Briother itself, then the wireless combo IS cost-effective.  Brother essentially competes here only with itself.)  That said, it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone's printing if several of you are running off of a wireless router.  There are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you.  It's a complete standalone fax/copier if someone in the house doesn't even have any computer at all.  I'm a long-time Brother customer, and they've made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone.  There were a few bugs in earlier machines by Brother (comparable but older machines I've owned, like the 8500 and the 9700) such as faulty out-of-toner warnings, and all of these seem to have been worked out.  This machine is clearly out of beta.  Earlier machines were difficult (though not impossible) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual, and this machine is far better on that aspect as well.  You can have faxes arrive two-sided, which doubles your paper tray effectively, and you can scan or fax a two-sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting.  This last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease-of-use - you wouldn't use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two-sided page.  Unfortunately, the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the Brothers is the "ink" aspect.  Unlike some competitors, you have to replace a toner AND a drum, and at differing intervals. I assume they do this to keep the costs low, but the costs still aren't particularly low.  The non-wireless version of the basic machine sells for a little over $400, and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners.  I don't understand why printers of all sorts cannot just have a "gas tank" you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper, but in most instances, the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer.   The Brother is a superbly-functioning modern machine at a great price, but don't imagine the price ends when you buy it.  This is true of all printers, however, and the news with most printers is worse than here
1 I can't say enough about the Tivoli AM/FM radio!  It has superior sound and i love the design of the case as well.  Some folks might be hesistant to spend over $100 for a radio ... trust me - it is well worth it.  My girlfriend's parents have had an older version of this radio for over 30 years - still sounds great
1 I would encourage ANYONE in the market for a shredder to first identify WHERE the machine is to be placed! If you want something "cute" and compact, then, keep looking. This SB-97Cs is a work horse, in every sense of the word. Consequently, it may not appeal to one's feminine traits. Although the size can be a bit formidable for home use, it's power and relatively quiet operation set the standard for all others. I was surprised at just how quiet it was! The controls are easy to master, and the safety features are good to have for the occasional inquisitve child. Having had a lessor (un-named) shredder, I knew that my shredding needs were beyond the waste-paper-basket sized machines for less money. Being one who regularly shreds credit card "bait" checks, and other sensitve info that accumulates through the years, this SB-97Cs shredder was a must have. I doubt that I'll outgrow this machine. I've had this shredder for only a couple of months now, and I expect to have it for many years to come. It IS NECESSARY to oil the cutters after each full basket, though. If you are the disciplined and conscientious type, this is not a problem. However, I can see the lifespan of this machine being cut short by the negligent types who don't read instructions..
1 Simple, but does what it's supposed to.  Allows you to connect the audio output of a laptop/PC/iPod, etc., to the audio input on your TV.
1 This product has worked great with my 2Wire Gateway modem from AT&T Yahoo.The real plus has been the USB connection so its not necessary to take off the desktop's back panel. The connection has been good, and I set it up in minutes.I tend to think that people who are having connection problems have a problem with their router, and not this device.  I can see 50%+ networks from all over my neighborhood
1 This printer does an excellent job. The colors are vivid and the clarity is very crisp. The only negative is you are restricted to the canon paper with end tabs. Good value for a compact snap shot printer
1 Switch was simple to install to my existing network, just plug and go. I used this switch to separate some CPUs off of the 100mb network and put them on the gig highway. Worked just as planned and was seamless. I actually added two of these and saved big jack over a 16 port gig switch. Network speed and response time increased even for those CPUs w/out a gig nic. I like the idea of having a switch with capacity that far exceeds network traffic. Highly recommend
1 these cases are amazing!!  i love them!!  if i ever need to replace one of my dvds i always buy Memorex DVD Storage Cases.  there the next best thing, i think to the ones that come orignal with my store bought dvds.thanks Memorex!
1 This is the only type of speaker cable i use to connect my state of the  art sound system
1 While the two fans I ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly, they are not as advertised on Amazon's website.  According to the specs on the site, they have a double ball-bearing design which last longer than normal fans. Be warned, these are NOT the Antec double ball-bearing fans, but the less expensive ones.  Have contacted Amazon and hope they update the specs to reflect these accurately
1 this radar/laser detector is very good detects the police radarand the best is do not  false signals
1 It does everything promised but takes several hours of going over the instructions to figure out how to program some of the features.  Instructions hard to locate in booklet
1 I took my MP3 player into the store with me to check out earbuds.Eveyone I tried was terrible; so I ended up buying online.I read all the reviews, especially Amazon reviews; because the people know what they are talking about.I have bought 5 pair altogether for friends, and they love these buds too.The music I listen to ranges from Tupac to Vivaldi, and everything in between. My MP3 player has 9 EQ settings; I keep it on new age most of the time. The price is right, and the sound is the best.
1 A lot of TV for little money.  Great picture, and the refresh rate is fast enough to prevent most of the blurring that you tend to see on low end LCD's.  Initial setup can be tricky because Olevia chose to include a CD version of the operators manual, though you can print a paper version from the CD or Olevia website.  Better than average sound, but the side speakers add a bit to the overall width.  After tweaking the factory settings we achieved a nice color balance without any of the black level problems that plague many LCD's.  If you're using it in a bedroom you'll most likely be annoyed by the very bright on/off light on the front panel.  Rear panel connections are intuitive and easily accessible, and wall-hanging was a breeze.  Looked at many LCD televisions and there are better choices for sure, but it's hard to beat the performance of this set at the low price. Highly satisfied! 
1 I had great hope for this product.  It has, mostly, so far, lived up to my expectations.  Here are some caveats...I was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories...easy listening, dinner music, light jazz...etc.  You have to "cheat" to do this, and using the manual is daunting.  Instead of using the "Artist" as artist, I used it as a catagory code, ie making one artist light jazz, etc.  This works, but you do, of course lose the artist registration ability.So now, I can select "artist" "Dinner Music" and then "All Discs" and "Shuffle", and the unit will play a track from one "Dinner Music" CD then shuffle to another track on another "Dinner Music" CD, etc, making a delightful, mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way.I am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine, so longetivty, and flawlessness are not being reviewed here.  That remains to be seen.The manual is purely awfull.  Just dig in and try things.  That's the only way to get a handle on things.  Hope this helps....good luck!
1 This is a very nice TV for the money. Great picture and with the built in DVD player that plays CD's I was able to remove a big old CRT TV, DVD player and stereo from the bedroom. I'm happy with my choice
1 I gave this 5 stars only because it serves its purpose well. It's just a basic mouse pad, but the price is excellent!!
1 I received this printer a few days ago and I am very impressed. 4 X 6 photos look awesome as if I had Walmart print them and the speed is very fast. I hook it up to my Airport Extreme Base Station (I use a Powerbook) and print wirelessly and had no problems at all. Scanner is a tad bit noisy but a lot quieter than my old HP All in one printer that just kicked the bucket.The software is easy to use and understand. I never read the directions and I was scanning in pictures with in minutes. I also like the LCD display on the printer. Its nice to just "pop" in a memory card, and view the photos you want to print. It saves time when you don't have to download them to the computer then print them.Overall I am vey pleased and I did my search on this printer and all of the reviews were very good. I was torn between Canon (I actually bought a Canon Pixma and returned it) and HP and I am glad I stuck with HP, always a trusted brand. And the price was about $40.00 dollars cheaper than any electronics store around.Pros:Excellent picture qualtyFast printingEasy setupA lot of featuresEasy to use and understand functionsCons:Scanner a litte noisy (quieter than my old HP)When printing the printer shakes my table (old HP did the same)I guess it is a little on the large side, but it doesn't bother m
1 I have just up-graded to a 40" HD samsung 1080p TV so I had to replace my 2 yr old onkyo 601 "great receiver" with this 674 model mainly for the HDMI switching capabilities, set-up was a little tricky but after an hour I was ready to try the audyssey set up mic. which was very straight forward & accurate Boy was I blown away. This thing has such clarity & separation I couldn't believe the difference over my older onk.rec.I have direct TV hd-dvr & Panasonic 1080i DVD player via HDMI through receiver, don't waste your money on those over priced monster cables, all of mine are 15-20 bucks from amazon. I am so pleased with my purchase I also feel this is a great value 599.00 I know their is not a better receiver out there at this price or even for 200.00 more. I would highly recommend this as the backbone to any quality home theater system. I read another review that expressed that you couldn't turn it up past 60,that is false I can crank mine up to max with with vertually no distortion
1 I recently purchased the Pacific Breeze Laptop Cooler and so far am very impressed with it.  Now this review should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have only had the cooler for a few weeks, but I feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate.  The reason that I was in search of a cooler was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps.  I installed Notebook Hardware Control (free temperature and power control utility) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55C at my hard drive!  Worried about how this would affect the hard drive's longevity, I started looking around at coolers.I choose this cooler after reviewing several of the "mat" variety, but chose this one because of its design.  As the previous reviewers have already mentioned, this cooler elevates the notebook from the rear and blows air under the notebook.  This allows the CPU fan intake and hard drive to receive plenty of fresh air.After setting this cooler up, I was feeling pretty good about the purchase.  Qualitatively, the results are evident by a cooler notebook top and keypad, and the feel of air exiting the sides of the notebook.  Quantitatively, the notebook experienced a 5C temperature drop at my HD and at my CPU.  Now my hard drive is running at 40C-45C instead of 45-50C!I would definitely recommend this product
1 Unlike the first reviewer my experience with Trigger Finer has been a good one. At first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in Impulse (Ableton Live) once I realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze. I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless. The htinkg is it is soo expandable and programmable it may be to its own detriment especaiily for peolle who are not fimiliar with mapping out midi controllers
1 I just love the color, the stile  and the price.It is a perfect player.     Thank you.
1 for the money, I got a good quality product. My purchase experience was good, and product was received in a timely manner
1 I bought this cable half minded reading the other reviews and i was bit worried whether it will work. When i hooked up the cable between my laptop and TV, wow.... this is really worth a buy.
1 We received this item very quickly.  It was exactly what we ordere
1 Umm. This is ink. Not much to say other than it works fine with my Epson R320 Printer
1 We looked at many TV stands to go with the Sony TV we were buying.  Only a few were worth considering, but finally decided to go with the Sony unit designed for our specific TV.  Am I glad we did!  It has hold downs to secure the TV and the cable straps at the rear are easy to use and make the installation clean and clear.  Very nicely designed, along with being good looking
1 Great joystick! I didn't think I could find any better than my Sidewinder, but I was wrong! Very configurable and smooth
1 This memory card works great with my 15" PowerMac laptop.  I've had a noticeable increase in speed with no hitches. 
1 No problem whatsoever with this product.  It was delivered in a timely manner and worked perfectly
1 I've never tried verbatim media, since there were 5inch computer floppy disc (circa 1983-85).  I pleased to find that verbatim still makes a quality product
1 I've seen others coaster from day 1 and I've seen others coaster after day 60 (after an actual succesfull write!) but these are absolutely awesome. Highly reliable ... long-term
1 Wow, I'm surprised by the reviews made here about this product. Despite the bad reviews, I bought it anyway.  I still believe in a Motorola.  Guess what?  Not bad.  I bought this phone set and 4 of its satellites to replace my Siemens.  The Siemens was the best phone when it first came out about 5 years ago.  This Moto phone has the features most people will ever need.  The shared phonebook is very valuable.  A loud speakerphone on each handset is priceless.  Incoming and outgoing sound quality is excellent.  I don't understand why there are several reviews here stating the phone has bad sound quality.  Ok, the range is not as good as my 2.4ghz phone but it is not bad for someone with an average size home.  After about 75 meters with 3 walls in between, I can start to hear the voice I'm speaking to, crackles.  I just did this for test but I can get clear voice anywhere in my 4 bedroom house.  I am running a 2ghz wi-fi and do not hear any interference. With regard to the phonebook, I wish I can enter more characters each address!  The maximum characters I can enter is only 11.  I think I can enter about 20 on my Siemens.  Another minor quirk is when someone called, I could just lift the phone off its charging base and start talking to the other party.  Not with this phone.  I still have to press the "flash" bottom everytime before I can start talking.  Build quality is excellent.  It is a little on the heavy side which I like probably because it uses 4 rechargeable batteries and made of thick plastic.  Even if I squeeze the handset hard, I didn't hear that plasticky noise and feeling of the plastic warping.  I tried the Pana, V-Tech, Uniden, GE, and ATT in a local store and the Motorola is tops. You will not see a rubbery wiggly buttons here.  I personally think this is the best phone among the few remaining brands around.  If you do not see it that way, it must be a quality defect that can happen on any product.
1 I'm so happy with these speakers. For the price, the sound is utterly amazing. I have a good moderately priced system, and these speakers really make it special. No one can believe the crystal highs or the big bass coming from such  humble-looking speakers
1 This radio has excellent features for someone who is either new to shortwave radio or just wanting a simple, user-friendly set of controls.  Also perfect for those that like analogue-style controls that would be encountered on older radios.  I have the S-350, the model that the S-350DL replaces.  For general world band programme listening, this radio is fantastic.  Outstanding speaker.  Easy to read digital display includes backlight.  Includes attenuator.  Clock can be set to 24 hour time.  Easy to carry anywhere.  Robust antenna.  Does not support SSB tuning, which you would need to tune in Ham radio.  Same radio sold under Tescun name in other parts of the world
1 I don't know what was wrong w/ the other reviewers machine, but let me assure you, this is NOT an inferior product. I got it on Clearance @ Target for $69.98. I have been looking for a long time for a good portable DVD player. I have used it and had NO problems with it whatsoever. Plus if anything does happen in the first 90 it is fully returnable to Target. Good Deal all around. Highly reccomended.
1 Below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks.Pros:-----1. Amazing sound especially when watching DVD movies2. Very good progessive scan DVD picture quality3. Simple, compact and all-in-one design4. Remote control can work with various TV's, Cable boxes and VCR's5. Can play both NTSC and PAL DVD'sCons:-----1. Expensive2. No HDMI output3. Non-intuative remote control4. No headphone jackOverall, I love and chose the Bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design. I got this system because I wanted a compact all-in-one media center and I was not interested in getting a HTIB with 5 speakers. I looked at Denon (2 products), Sony and Samsung.I use this on my 23" Samsung LCD TV using Monster component video cables and while I would have preferred to take advatange of its HDMI capabilties, the reality is that I am very happy with this image quality. Movies such as Lord of the Rings, The Matrix and Hero look and sound fantastic. Prior to this I was looking at the Sony DAV-X1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich. However the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me. For example, my PAL DVDs cannot be played on the Sony whereas on the Bose it was no problem. I am of the opinion that Sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products.To be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their TrueSpace 2.1 surround sound feature. My couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me. According to Bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the TV. Sometimes TrueSpace works and sometimes I can't hear it. I believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other. If surround sound is really that important to you, then you should get a 5.1 system. This product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3D sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room.The audio quality from music CD's is very good and while I wish this had an iPod port as found on the Denon, I am very content using the Aux port
1      My [...] girl and [...] boy both love their players. The [...]really likes the Sonic games and the ability to connect it to the TV. On a TV the 8 bit graphics are jagged but he does not care and the games are playable. The builtin screens are a little low in resolution if you look closely but cartoons look good and the kids have not noticed anything.      The players have a nice lock feature to disable the controls so that the movie is not accidentally stopped. They have both dropped the players serveral times and they both continue to work well. The only problem is that the [...] had figured out how to remove the battery pack. She does this at times then gets upset the movie stopped.     The players come with everything, AC and auto adapters, a remote control, earphones, built-in stand, battery pack and the wires to play the movies and the games directly on an a TV with RCA jacks
1 This product is good. I haven't seen any issues with this so far...
1 Mouse is comfortable to use, and I haven't had any problems with it so far.  I did have some difficulty hooking it up to my computer, but once I figured out the problem it was all smooth sailing from there.  It is my first wireless mouse, so I have nothing else to compare it to, but i definitely like it a lot better than my old mouse. 
1 I needed this cable to use with my Garmin Rino 120 because my new laptop didn't have a serial adapter. My first try was to use a similiar product from Radio Shack, but I found the Radio Shack product was very confusing to use and was unstable.  I ordered the CP Technologie product from Amazon and it worked great! Also, the CP Tech product was less than half the cost of the Radio Shack product (including shipping)
1 I tried many other adapters and this was the only one that worked for my PDA
1 This Wall Mount works and hold's great. I used it for an Olevia 542I LCD Flat Panel and have had no problems. The instructions are not all that clear, but it is not hard to figure out how to instal
1 I wanted a simple printer so I could print a few prints from time to time to hand out. On sale for $50, this seemed like the right one. I already had the included Zoombrowser and Photo Stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a Canon A95 camera, so I just needed to install the driver. Note this requires a USB cable (not included) to the printer.As is human nature, I tried to print without reading the Zoombrowser instructions, and got a lovely plain sky-blue print with the words "My Album" on it - but no photo :-) Then, out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines - this was from a residual click from my first attempt. Ok, Ok, so I looked at the PDF printing guide for about 15 seconds, and followed the instructions.Got a beautiful first print of the Queen Mary ship. Got a gorgeous second print of flags (red/white/blue, and green) againt a clear blue sky, and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near Mt Lassen (ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints...)So, I've blown through the provided "trial" 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge, and have 3 very nice prints (with postcard address lines, stamp area and Canon logo on the back - the paper comes that way.) The ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1/2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing.I can't compare the printing software to any other brand, but setting up a plain photo-only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices. If you want to add backgounds, titles/text, etc, that is available as well. (Got another pack of paper/film, and put humorous captions on kind of funny-bad office Christmas pix...)Printing directly from my A95 takes about the same time as from the computer - about 1 min 45 sec.The actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times (3 color passes and a protective layer) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed, particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot. The finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front.  The unit looks and feels substantial for its small size, comes well packed (survived NY to CA shipping), has decent documentation, and a 1-year warranty.
1 Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, "grabbing" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the "drift" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM.If you're looking for a radio with similar features as the Grundig S350 DL but erases its weakness--no presets and AM overload, then you might want to check out the Grundig G4000A. It's the same price as the S350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio. Or you might look at the stunning Kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the Eton E5. But even if you get a fancy preset radio, every house should have the big easy-to-use Grundig S350 Deluxe.Update: Comparing the S350 to the same-priced G4000 for several months, it becomes clear that the G4000 is a better buy: superior AM, superior separation of AM stations, presets, same warm speaker, and smaller.
1 These folks continue to amaze me with their advancement of the state of the art in memory, and Amazon purchase and delivery is so dependable it's like money in the bank.  I hope no one comes in and tries to "improve" things.
1 I must admit I read many other reviews of this item and was a little apprehensive, however... .  I found this recorder to be outstanding in all the items I've tried so far. I initially just hooked it up like my old one was and left it for a few hours after manually setting the time (before reading the instructions) . This made things more difficult so I started over, set it for everything to be automatic, including the time, left it until the next evening and allowed it to do its' thing - which it did magnificently. EVERYTHING worked beautifully and it did a great job. I LOVE the one-touch recording. I found it's best to read directions one at a time as I want to try something new and have had no problems. So far I haven't tried everything it will do but find it's very intuitive and not a bit frustrating to use. It's a joy to hit the TVGuide button, highlight the shows I want to watch and hit the record button. So far I have no complaints
1 Great new product!  Easy to use and turns my audio ipod into a portable media player.  I can even use it to record my favorite tv shows.  I highly recommend this product
1 For this price these are a steal! Purchased mine for $15 (with shipping) and let me tell you, it was worth it! The headphones come with a 1/4 converter too! So you can use them for cd players and amps! The sound quality is good, and the headphones don't hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours. These are an amazing deal for the price, I'm honestly surprised these arn't marked for $50. Don't pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones
1 I live in an apartment building and play ( well, practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so I wouldn't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs TV about 6 feet from where I sit and play.The 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing, so I wouldn't have to use an extention cable ( and usualy end up with feedback/distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable)The volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so I don't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings I like to use when not using headphones.  Makes it real nice too when using an instructional CD or DVD i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head.Very light weight.  Some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads'.  Fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere.  Cord enters headphones on the left ear side, so you don't have to deal with the classic 'Y' split cord.  Easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way.Earpices fit nicly over my ears (no pinching, gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear) and does a very nice job blocking out noise ( when my wife is awake she watchs the TV, rather loudly, which is right next to me and I bairly notice it). Plenty of padding around the ear pieces.   Many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear, but these headphones I honestly don't feel anything against my ears.  Even after several hours of use each night.Sound quality.  Bose or pioneer they are not, but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn't be shopping in the $20 and under headphones :)That being said they are very good for sound.  Sounded very good on a portable CD player.Only drawbacks I can see is that a person with large/tall ears won't get thier ears covered by the earpads.  The inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1/4 inchs tall by 1 3/4.  IMO they could have been made bigger.Also, if you have a tall head ( good distance from top of head to ear ) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears.I have a head like Drew Carry ( give you an idea head size/shape I'm talking about) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn't have fit.I wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don't interfere, bind, pinch or anything like that with my glasses.So, I highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after( I don't recomend things often :) )    
1 when i opened my package i was a little disappoined with this product but after using it for a while i learned to like it. it is easy to use the front controls with the inno but akward to turn on and off. overall a nice case. shoped around and found amazon had best price with free shipping. received in about one week
1 Still embarking on spooling off all the Hi-8 tapes I have, but I've been VERY satisfied with the Plextor unit so far.  First thing I did was to spool one Hi-8 tape and then make a DVD, using the functionality of the bundled WinDVD Creator software.  Good news: it worked, and a few hours after I started, I was watching the DVD I created, on my bedroom DVD player.  Bad news: the software is full of minor and sometimes more than minor annoyances.  It may be that I'm still climbing the learning curve with it, but I think it's just not very good.  I'm looking into other solutions, such as Pinnacle, Adobe Premiere Elements, etc.  Meanwhile, I keep spooling.I haven't yet tried the TV capture in any depth.  It looked like it worked, but again, with some annoyances on the software side.  Plextor could improve this offering vastly with the addition of some better bundled software
1 I bought these for some Sony surround sound speakers, although I was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is(essentially) plastic.  However, they turned out to be very sturdy, and easy to install.  I also have to commend the mannufacturer for including very detailed instructions as well as a large selection of mounting hardware.  Well worth the price
1 Popped it in, works like a charm. Hardest part is opening the packaging, but other than that no worries
1 "My husband and I bought this for our new home and we're both thrilled!  He loves that it holds our new TV and stereo system, and I love the way it looks. It's extremely sturdy and he was able to put it together in less than a couple of hours. We're so glad we found something we could both agree on!  What a great piece of furniture!
1 They are good for the price. They have a very good sound quality, or at least better than the ones that came with my Sony Walkman DEJ001. The only problem I had is when I connected them to my older Philips player, it had a low volume output. And then again, even on the Sony player, I had to have the volume at 7, and it only goes to 9. If you have a high output player or a computer, these will be great, but if your using them for a low output or old device, these probably won't cut the cheese
1 Easy to mount on the wall. Though this item came with hardware with different sizes, I still had to buy some hardware with different length than what they supplied. This mount perfectly suited for my 46" Sony LCD flat panel. In about 30 min, I could mount TV on this bracket.
1 seems to be good quality. has a strong rubber scent, and no cutouts for the 4 small buttons though
1 The reviewer below identifying himself as "An Electronics Fan" obviously has a deep bias against Bose.  His multiple reviews about Bose products--here and elsewhere--are transparently motivated by some animus against Bose.  Was he fired by Bose? Did a member of the Bose family reject his romantic advances?  Did a Bose executive accidentally run over his cat?  Did he drop a Bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe? The true motivation for this guy's negative reviews would be fun to know.  In the meantime, what we do know is that he has no credibility, and his reviews (two here, others elsewhere for other Bose products; he's made maligning Bose his life's work, apparently)) should disregarded.I bought a set of black 301's several years ago to go with my Onkyo receiver.  We have it hooked up to a television and DVD player for movies.  These speakers are in constant use both for the DVD and for music of all types.  The room in which they are placed is huge, with an 18 foot-high flat ceiling.  The speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day. The speakers work fine for spoken audio for DVD's; we can hear dialogue perfectly; I feel no particular need for a surround-sound system. Several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto. I feared a ruptured speaker cone, but the 301's are very forgiving, no damage has been done. The cats sleep on the speakers; they clean right up and still look new after five years.  These speakers keep on giving total satisfaction, and I quite simply love them.About three years ago I decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market, or at least what I determined to be best after a lot of research. This included a set of the gold-series tower speakers from Monitor Audio. (The speaker cones are metallic, with some amount of gold, and gold connections, etc., etc.) These Monitor Audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made (real wood veneer cabinetry, with the gold cones and the black covers, etc.). These speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each.  Well, I must confess, as awesome as the Monitor Audios sound, I can't really say they sound any better than the Bose 301's!!! They can maybe handle more power, but I assure you the Bose 301's will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less.So, when I recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom, I looked forward to buying a third type of speakers.  I ran around and listened to what I could find on display.  Well, after much contemplation, I went for a second set of the Bose 301's!!!  They just couldn't be beat, and I would have gladly spent more if I had found something I liked better. But I'm not going to spend more just so I can say I spent a lot...there has to be increased performance. And, in my opinion, the 301's couldn't be out-performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range. My first set of 301's were black.  This time I went for the cherry. Folks, these are absolutely beautiful speakers: almost as cool looking as my Monitor Audios.  The black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood. No, it is not real wood, but it looks very nice.  These things are simply gorgeous. The kind of "mod" or futuristic shape which Bose has designed really stands out in this lighter-colored version.  And, yes, they sound just as good as my original pair.  I listen to soft music (jazz, typically, or ambient) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume; I listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions, and the 301's don't scare away or distort at all: these things would tear the house apart before they'd lose sound quality.So, yes, I recommend these highly.  They'd still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price
1 I have two iPods that don't work.  I bought a shuffle first and that has an error that I can't fix and Apple can't fix.  So, I thought I'd buy 1GB iPod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer.  So, this time I made the right decision and bought the 30 GB Zune.  Wow!  The Zune is so much better!  It has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely, instead of making you frustrated like the iPod.  The screen is perfect.  Sound quality is excellent.  5 Stars for the Zune. 
1 I liked this charger so much that I ended up ordering a second unit. Premium solid performance in addition to 3 years warranty! I called Lenmar company since the fan on the second charger did not work out of the box but guess what, they sent me another charger without hussle! The call took about 2 minute and the replacement part was already on its way, they definetly stand by and back up their warranty. No problems with the second unit and If I ever need another one I would still buy a lenmar. The two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar PPRO-H batteries, one can use the slot number 1 and 4 for regular NiMH batteries, it charges regular high capacity batteries to an 80% level in less than 15 minutes, and the other PPRO-H batteries in about 7-8 minutes. I didn't notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the PPRO-H batteries, but the PPRO-H kind are more durable. This charger is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage 110-240 V and the first to use NeoTherm® charging technology! it's solid and heavy duty charger, not like the cheap kind that are everywhere. I went through lots of sony chargers but you know what? They will never see my money again! the sony chargers are crappy and fry a lot, I have been using the MSC815 since October 2005 almost daily and never once I had an issue with it
1 I don't bother charging my Zune from the computer any more. This is the only way to go
1 This is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl's room! The picture is great and Hello Kitty pops on screen for certain commands (volume, channel change..). My daughter age 4 loves it. I would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks...the remote control is has SO many buttons and they are VERY tiny, very close together. I can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also VERY tiny. This is annoying when in my daughter's darkened room and I have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button... the other thing I have to point out that bugs me is that you can't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode. In other words when I go to put in a dvd, I can't just push "open". Nothing will happen. You have to find the right button, choose "dvd" from a choice of 3-4 things, and only then will the tray slide open. All in all, these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again...although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize... One great thing I want to point out--there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards (something not all dvd players offer) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads....you can FF right to the beginning of the movie!!!    
1 I love the feel of this gamepad...after trying several others this is the best. The wireless works ok, i was 20 feet away and it was working.The batteries are what needs improving according to many posts. I thought i had a dead battery but it ended up being a bad connection inside. With a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the battery case. on the positive side of each battery there are two small pieces of plastic. you just need to push these down so the battery has a better chance of connectiing. i also found new batteris at interstate battery store, 1 dollar each. The analog sticks could be a little tighter, but i like the d pad. wireless is great
1 This compact mini was exactly what we needed to use as a server for our photography studio. All computers can pull from it with no noticible slow down. It was the smoothest install and network to our 6 computers. I will buy another very soon to use as a backup to the first
1 Garmin has great ideas that suffer from the company they belong to.  This option is a great thing to add to your 305 if you spin indoors or want to increase the accuracy of the GPS.  NOW if only the software was smart about how and when to use the Sensor ...
1 This Sharp electronic dictionary is the perfect pocket companion for those times when you don't have your laptop, or a dictionary handy.  The interface is intuitive and the keyboard is amongst the best I've ever used on this type of device.  Moreover, the access times for Dictionary and Thesaurus lookups are very fast; the "phrase search" function is a little bit slower, but not intolerable.  There are also "crossword puzzle" and "anagram solver" functions that I have not used, but I imagine work fine.  Another positive for this product is the fact that it uses a single AAA battery, not some watch-type cell battery.The only negative is that it does not have a backlight for the screen, but neither do many of the other comparable dictionaries.  Hopefully Sharp will smarten up and put that in a future version of the PW-E550.  I believe this is BY FAR the best electronic dictionary you can get for less than $100, and no, I do not work for Sharp Electronics
1 Our Oskar Multimedia Storage Cabinet arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. My husband assembled the unit with ease, until it was time to nail the card board backing on. Following the instructions he laid the unit down on it's face, of course the kick-board had already been added so it didn't lay flat. When nailing on the backing the "J" board (the center shelf holding the entire unit together) split at every point of contact.We had ordered our Oskar Storage Cabinet through Amazon, directly from Ritz Camera. So, naturally I called Ritz to replace the "J" shelf. I was informed I would have to return the entire unit. I immediately pictured myself trying to get all those shelves back into the box and figured that was more trouble than I wanted to go through.So, I tracked down the number for Oskar and called them directly. They were very efficient and helpful. Within minutes I had their assurance that they would ship a new "J" shelf to my home - at no additional charge. The shelf arrived within the promised ten-days.This unit was exactly what we ordered and works well for it's intended purpose. I would caution you to be very careful nailing on the backboard, so as not to split the center shelf. My favorite feature of the Oskar Multimedia Wood Storage Cabinet is that they include plenty of extra shelves, unlike so many other brands. I have an entire stack of shelves that I can add as needed. I would love to have three or four more of these units.
1 I used this recorder alot, I have alot of classes,and the playback is good, it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you haven't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record.  The sound quality is good, 36h record time which can be broken up to folders.  The only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume, i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low,and that goes vice versa as well,. Nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons
1 This is about the only mouse I buy, have gone through a couple of them in the past few years.  I just can't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out.  This model is one that I find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using.  If you want a good, reliable, comfortable mouse, this logitech is a good choice
1 This is a great product for those who probably don't write too much. As an engineering student, I found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable - however, it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class. Plus, It would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally
1 This has been the best investment I've made for quite some time.  After experiencing the black out after the earthquake that hit Hawaii last year and having my computer die, I invested into this unit.  I read a few reviews from various sites that said there was issues with it and that often times it came broken.  I thought to myself the good reviews outweigh the bad so I'm going to try it and see.  Sure enough this unit came with no problems.  I plugged it in and let it charge over night.  I then added my computer and my monitor to it.  I've seen it kick in while the lights dimmed at my home and I'm so thankful that it has saved my computer.  If anything everyone should invest in one of these for their computers.  I fix computers for a living and more often than not people bring in their dead computers due to a power outage or power surge
1 This item is BR1500, which also called RS model vs. the BX1500 called XS models.  External battery BR24BP can be used for both BR1500 and BX1500.  The capability to connect external battery is great, since that can help reduce the downtime when California experiencing "rolling black" in the summer.There are basically 2 differences between the Back-UPS RS(BR1500) and the Back-UPS XS (BX1500) models besides their names.1. The Back-UPS RS models have both 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem data-line protection and 10/100base-T ethernet protection, where as the Back-UPS XS models only has 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem protection.2. The Back-UPS RS models have both Boost* and Trim** as features of Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR), where as the Back-UPS XS only has Boost. When the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a Back-UPS XS model it will only go to battery.*AVR Boost: The UPS is compensating for a low utility voltage. While the UPS can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the UPS, the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently low.**AVR Trim: The UPS is compensating for a high utility voltage. While the UPS can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the UPS, the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently high. BX1500 does not have the AVR trim feature, when AC line voltage is higher than spec, it will switch over the battery power till the line voltage drops into the spec range.Please note this is called "backup UPS", not the "smart UPS" line.  Backup UPS does not produce pure sine wave. When power lost, it will take some milli-seconds to switch over to battery power.  "Smart-UPS" produces sine wave and the output AC was from DC source all the time. When AC input lost, the AC output will not have any interrupt.For most computers, the "backup-UPS" is good enough, since the power supply inside PC always have capacitors that can hold for about 100MS or longer. When "backup-UPS" switched over in about 20MS, the computer will continue operates without much impact.  But for A/V equipment, this may be an issue, especially the output is not pure sine wave.  I would not recommend use this UPS for A/V equipment
1 This is truly the best WIFI you can get on the market right now. Its lightning fast its 4 machines put into 1. Most importantly I've had the best gaming experience ever. Now i can host games on Xbox live without lagging the rest of my teammates and that is no fun. The Linksys WRT330N Wireless-N Gigabit Gaming Router is well worth its money and a great investment. I recommend it highly to anyone that needs a great WIFI for whatever reason
1 I already have two of these for my heavy rear bose speakers. The speakers are about are about 10 lbs each and are easily handled.The mounts are solid, and can be oriented in any direction easily. I am about to by three more for my center, and two fronts.I highly recommend
1 I have an Explorist 210 and this bracket fits it like a glove.  Good sturdy bracket, uni-directional, with strong suction cups - installed over a month ago and still has not come loose from windshield.  Great product for the money (in my case $30.76 + free shipping).  Purchased a second one for my other vehicle.
1 This product is really what I expected it to be. It has a very clear display with a high resolution for a 4 inch screen. The stereo sound is really good. And it has a long lasting battery. Buttons are easy to use. I tried recording from the television, and it is also satisfying. I had no problem about any divx or xvid video type. I really enjoy watching films with cowon a2.
1 i am so satisfied with this product that i had to come back and write a review on this. it has good picture quality and sound quality is amazing! battery lasts very long which is very very useful n important feature for portable players. I love to watch movies on this and also love to connect this to my TV and watch on a big screen any place i go
1 I did a bunch of research before i bought the a2. The things that sold me on it were :        1. Battery life.        2. It's got a voice recorder & encodes direct to MP3        3. I love the fact that it's "folder view" , all my music on my PC is   organized by Artist then Album anyway, so it's just copy and paste to get it onto the a2.Which leads to.................        4. Just copy mp3's & avi's on there like a removable USB drive.        5. A/V out to TV is cool.        6. A/V in to record video is a nice extra.So far it's played every avi i've thrown at it. I've got 15GB of music on there and just let it random play the whole lot I use the a2 mostly when driving. I got a nice FM transmitter that powers off the cig socket, sound quality is pretty good. Only problem i have is that i have to carry the a2 in the house at night for fear of it getting stolen out of the car !I also invested in the silicon cover from zcover-it comes with a plastic screen protector and is perfect for when my 2 yr old wants to watch one of his movies on there (the a2 makes for a great pacifier !)Mine came with the latest firmware on there so there was no need to upgrade.I'm very happy with the a2 and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for am honest to goodness media player and has no need for subscription services or any other force fed crap.        
1 Works great out of the box. Some reviews mentioned problems with the CD but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try.  It mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet.  No problem with signal strength happy to say since the unit it replaced had problems.  The brightness of the digital clock is adjustiable and I use it as a night light in the kitchen.  The remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater (magnet) with my wife useing it to hang things.  This is a Thomson Inc product (purchased the GE & RCA names several years ago) that makes TV's ect.I am very happy with the product and recommend it
1 i've used allot of different adapters but this one is got to be the best ever. the Linksys WPC54GX4 work with all routers,but when you pair it up with the Linksys WRT54GX4 router look out, my range increased and i'm getting upwards of 250mb of speed, setup is also a breeze
1 I purchased this dehumidifier to tackle my overly-humid house.  I live in California, but my house is naturally very humid (around 75% on average).  The humidity frequently gets up to around 80% and above in the winter as verified with a hygrometer.  Mold was fast becoming a problem.  I have used this dehumidifier for over two weeks now, and it is scary how well it works!  I placed it in the bedroom were the hummidity was at it's highest, and it lowered my 15'x15' room from 75% to 50% in less than three hours!It has a quiet fan that I have no problem sleeping with.  The tank is easy to empty and it is light enough to move from room to room.I have not owned any other dehumidifiers before, so I have no basis of comparison, but I am in love with this one!  It was completely worth the price
1 I bought it in Feb 2006, never had any problem. Occasionally it stops working and just restarting both the units (sender and receiver) fixes the problem. I am so satisfied I am buying another pair
1 This has got to be the easiest piece of tech I have ever set up. Except for charging, it took under 5 minutes. It works as advertised. I use SkypeIn and SkypeOut. My phone bill is now $68 a year instead of $384. I also get voice mail for free with the SkypeIn. Call quality seems as good as Ma Bell. I was concerned with it being made by Netgear, as I have had spotty luck with their products. I liked this phone so much, I just purchase another handset(It can support up to 4). This phone will pay for itself in a few months
1 Im not a professional keyboard player. I bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and Guitar Pro.  It suits those needs great.  Its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing. The keyboard itself is extremly small reminds me of a kids toy keyboard.  If your looking for something more professional you will probably have to fork out the $100 bucks and get the bigger model. 
1 This is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference. But to see the beam (not just the dot at the end of the beam) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of. Using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out. And if you are wondering, no matter how bright your laser is, without particles in the air you wont see the beam. At concerts where they use the big argon lasers, they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of
1 Although I prefer the AKG K701 for most of my listening, this competing entry from Beyer is so close that it's almost a coin toss. (One recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat.) This is surprising, considering that the DT880 is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid-priced headphones. The bass is full but nicely textured - not a touch of bass bloat to be found here. The highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me, and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage. Instead of the music being on top of your, these Beyers lend a perceived distance of a few feet; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant, and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way. These headphones don't require a headphone amp, but certainly profit from one. The 30 ohm version makes for more volume, though the 250 ohm version is standard, and best for most daily listening. The DT880 sounds great, but lacks a tad of the K701's high-end sparkle. Conversely, Beyer's value, comfort, and workmanship can't help but impress. This is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the AKGs and the Senn 650s, but listeners are always impressed by the DT880s sound. It may be your best value in a mid-priced, all-purpose headphone
1 This has a nice size screen. It only has 3 buttons.Play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it. I was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button. I just found this out by trial. There was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital. This would only last a second or two. At first I thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them. The volume control is on the side, as well as the power button. It could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me
1 Very good product. Small, easy to store. Well worth the very reasonable price
1 Great invention to those who don't want to be attached to an IPOD, and like an updated version of a "juke box". Easy to use, load, unfortunately however, it requires an receiving unit to broadcast the sound
1 I'm not any expert in the computer world. But this product it is very easy to install. The range is very strong.I'm very hapy with this product!!!
1 I have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises, but it works nonetheless, and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house, I figure I ought to be grateful that it works at all. I do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections, but I suspect it's related to where I have things in the house, no so much the product. In fact, I can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up. Install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine. It's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed. Can't complain, especially for the price
1 I bought a ZEN 30G MP3 player and could not stand the earbuds they came with. They hurt so much that I used head phones until these V-MODA earbuds came in. They are awesome.  The fit is so comfortable and the sound it wonderful. I got them on sale for less than they are running right now on Amazon, so I feel pretty good about the purchase.  =
1 Being that the TV reception coming out of my VCR is always crappy, the first thing I did after getting my Monster Cable SV1/100-M A/V cable (to test is out) was plug one end it into my cable box's A/V output jack, then plug the other end into one of my VCR's A/V input jacks.  The result?  The TV reception coming through the VCR wasn't crappy anymore!!I ended up getting two of these A/V cables to hook up my Sony DVD player to my TV via a Terk VS-4 switch.  The picture is phenomenal!!  I plan to get two more soon to improve the reception from my VCR & my cable box.  These A/V cable are worth EVERY penny that you spend on them!!  You can't go wrong with Monster Cable!
1 This is a great card for a laptop, however they need to correct their problems with the installer for XP. Also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge, took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line. Once you do get to them they fix the problem right away, seems they know it will not install correctly. Then it works great
1 The product description is incorrect, USB 2.0 works fine on the newer Macs that have such ports. It's overpriced; buy a gently-used one
1 I use this bag to carry my HP NC6000 business notebook. I have received many complements on this bag
1 This is a great product for a busy professional or grad student who gives their Mac a lot of mileage.  I'm in law school, so I'm constantly throwing my computer in my bag along with heavy casebooks, keys, and other junk.  My old iBook survived tremendous abuse, and after two years looked like it had been through a war.  The Speck case protects the MacBook's shell and even the screen, in a roundabout way.  Normally, if you put a Mac into a briefcase or bag with heavy books, the books will press against the shell, and the screen inside will press against the keys leaving dents and screwing the the LCD.  The Speck case is very stiff, so even the heaviest books and the worst abuse don't push the screen onto the keyboard.  Plus, if you put a red case on a white Mac, people will think you're in some secret club that has access to red Macs.Cons: it's next to impossible to remove the top case with two hands - you need a buddy to get it off.  Also, dust starts to collect under the bottom case (static?), so you need to take off the bottom monthly to clean.  Fortunately the bottom case is easier to remove for cleaning. 
1 I am using this bag for school in which I need to carry 4 textbooks, a laptop (15.4 inch screen) and a couple of notebooks.  The pack has plenty of room for these items and still a couple of empty front pockets for additional gear.  With all that weight, the pack is still comfortable to wear and has yet to bother my back
1 These DVDs are probably the highest quality and most reliable that I have tried.  And given their low price, what is there not to like?  I would recommend these to just about anyone
1 In comparison to the component cables, the quality is a little better.  I don't think I agree with those who say you MUST have HDMI cables to get a good picture, but I am extremely satisfied with the product and I don't regret purchasing it.  Amazon's price for this product is unmatched
1 Totally agree with the other reviewers' comments. Originally, I was going to buy Canon's adapter for my Powershot A640 not realizing it was plastic!! Plus, even with shipping, this is still cheaper (by 5 bucks) and its metal! FYI--If you don't have any filters (like I didn't) get Tiffens 3 filter set 52mm (Circular Polarizer, UV protector, and 812-warming len) a good buy for the price--I bought it because of the reviewers' comments and don't regret it
1 It costs 30% - 40% less than the Canon LA-DC58F Conversion Lens Adapter and it's metal, not plastic... need to say more
1 I purchased 4 of these adapters (3 extra) so I could hook up my macbook's digital output for digital surround sound through my Logitech speakers. The product works exactly as I expected... great digital sound from my macbook. Parts Express did an excellent job of getting my order to me sooner than I expected (ordered on a Saturday, and they had the package to the courier by Saturday night.) Very prompt service... I would definitely order from them again. Overall a great product from a prompt company!
1 I've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years.  I've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday.  I ride a motorcycle everyday and I never leave without these.  First, the comfort is exceptional.  Even with my helmet on, I never get uncomfortable with these in my ears.  I've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems.  Even when I need a break from the music, I leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise.  I've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a helmet on.  The "bulb" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear, so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep.  Second, the sound quality is fantastic.  Great bass, mids, and highs.  I've heard things in my music I never knew was there and I can't wait to listen more.  I can't recommend these enough.  I've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine
1 Excellant product, excellant price, hope to do business again, ty, for fast speedy shipment, a pleasure doing business with you
1 This really works, i have 3 zp100's and 1 zp80, using a NAS for storage of my mp3's. the whole thing hangs together perfectly. if you want to get music through your whole house this is a great way to do it. MOST IMPORTANTLY TECH SUPPORT IS GREAT!!!
1 Wow! I didn't trust the other review.  I needed a mini amp, so I decided to bought this one, because of the price and of the dual purpose.  Right out of the box, it actually smell bacon!! Amazing, it was true!  And not only that.  If someone is trying to kick you out of your house because of the noise of your beloved amp, and don't want to stop, this is the mini amp for you.  Can't believe the speaker in it.  And, about the disto, well, is OK for practice. Won't regret about it.
1 I have had this items before, in fact this is a replacement for one that was mounted on my motor home. the windshield had to be replaced and a new antenna was needed. Works fine, just like the one before. A very eash purchase and fast delivery
1 I've been using this NAS for a month and it's great!  The box is quite speedy with a Maxtor ATA 133 drive with a 16mb cache.  I have it wired and it never disconnects and will transfer large files without hanging.  Got it up and working in around 40 minutes and have it set to incrementally back up my files.  Very slick!  I can't get the built in FTP server to work through my firewall but I think that's a ports issue.  All in all a great box
1 I wanted to be able to shoot lots over several days without dragging a laptop with me through multiple airports. I bought two and both worked fine, right out of the box. Not the fastest card ever, but certainly large storage for the price
1 When I bought these I was mainly looking for a long enough cord to be able to put my MP3 player in my pocket. Not only is the cord legnth great but so is the sound. I didn't expect the sound quality to be so good in such an inexpensive product. The cord also has a built in volume control so I don't have to dig the player out of my pocket to adjust the volume. The buds are quite comfortable, I have worn them for hours at a time with no problem. I love these
1 I just purchased a MoGo mouse, and I'm *amazed* at how usable it is.  I was extremely skeptical (and probably wouldn't have bought one) until I was able to try a colleague's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is.  The ONE thing - and it's a pretty big thing - is the lack of "scroll-wheel" technology.  That's a sorely missed feature in this mouse.That said, there are always trade-offs, but in this case that's the only one.  Battery life seems great, usability is great, convenience is great...just add the touch pad and it'll be THE mouse for notebook computer users!
1 When you look at the price, it may seem pricey but when you get the product, there is some serious engineering involved.  The web reviews have all been favorable and this is the reason I bought an Ergotron.  The attention to detail is incredible.  Mounting the middle monitor is definitely a two-person job. Other than that the installation was flawless.  This is a very solid and well machined.  Kudos to Ergotron.  (Also these guys are serious about ergonomics -- 10 pages on how to set proper height for various installations.) Wonderful product - 5 stars.  Shipping from Amazon was slow and behind schedule.
1 I am an IT Director and bought these for exercisers for my users. The outside is like a balloon, only much stronger rubber, and the inside is gel. When you squeeze them, the part that squeezes through your fingers changes color - it's cool! The resistance is very good and my users love them! Good product - great value and excellent quality
1 When you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great, but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate. It really seems to run out of one color much quicker  than the others. Personally its usually red. It has caught me with my pants  down a couple times, going to print out a project the night before its due,  only to run out of red or blue ink. I would definetly suggest to always  have an extra one around just in case
1 I use only the best products, not refills or other manufactures as I have had problems with print cartridges that have ruined my printers. The HP ink jet cartridges are the best. I will always buy them
1 This is a great case. I have had no problems with it, and works very well. It's also very "sexy" if you want to put it that way, and looks really cool. Only trouble I have is that when I open it sometimes, it'll make a click sound because 2 pieces touch, but its very minor and does no damage. It's a great item! However, if you intend to bang your laptop around a lot, I'd recommend one of those soft outer cases too, because this is not intended to protect the hard drive etc. Just protect it from scratches and smudges. I recommend it highly
1 After ruining another pair of over-the-head headphones, I decided to check these out.  They are actually on sale at 50% off, and I've just tried mine out.  The audio is very sharp, especially with the base, though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair, I can just increase the volume to compensate.  At $35, this is a GREAT deal.  They feel great.  The band that most headphones have presses down on your head, but not too much.  It also folds down quite nicely, though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress.  Haven't tried out the actual noise-cancellation feature, but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent, then it will work just as well.  It also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your MP3 player, if you so wished.  However, it easily fits into a jacket pocket.  Great, great, great design and comfort
1 This card works exactly as stated by StarTech. I bought two - one for a PC and one for a Mac, popped 'em in and plugged in iPods, external hardrives, a scanner, and digital cameras and the cards worked perfectly. The PC needed a quick setup and the Mac worked instantly!And all at a great price!Can't figger out why you guys are having trouble
1 Bought this player for its size (sports) and its Napster compatibility. Updated the firmware after having a rocky start; but things seem a little more stable now. Also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods (around 0 degrees Celsius) - odd behaviour - but mostly OK now that we are in the Spring teens again. Haven't found a case yet to protect from sweat. Interface is what I expected - dead simple. No complaints for the price
1 I was ready to take this player back to the store!  I checked the sandisk web site and stumbled across a link to "how to" videos.  This was the best thing I could have found.  The videos walk through all the settings you need to configure on your PC to get the player to work for drag and drop, showing album art...  I had no idea my PC was set not to show hidden folders!  Who would hide folders anyway?  Nonetheless I now have a player loaded with music and am a happy customer.  Like others have said the photo option is not that great so don't buy it for that.  I mostly want it for working out so pics don't make much of a difference to me.  DH has a 30G ipod so if I wanna see graphics I can just borrow that lol!I have over 250 mp3 formatted songs on the player (and it's full) and will likely get a micro SD card so I can expand it a little bit.All in all, I do like this little player
1 Excellent machine, great performance Saved lot of time and desk space. Great Scanning speed and qualit
1 I have had other APC battery backup's in the past, and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit.  Given our power failures, brown out, and the high wind and storms in our area the APC does an excellent job.  I have not only my desktop PC, but my scanner, printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures
1      I did a lot of research, not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later. I was about to buy the newest 40" 720p Samsung for $1899... then I stumbled upon this one at Circuit City for $1999 and bought it on the spot... paid about $50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later. I've had it a week now, and I love it.     Standard-definition picture quality is just okay, but are any of us buying these TVs to watch SDTV? I get about 15 HD channels through my cable company, including all four major networks plus ESPN, ESPN2 and a couple music and movie channels. Therefore, a majority of everything I watch is available in HD anyway. SDTV content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet. HD content looks awesome (including black levels), and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p. I can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available.     I'm going to wait another year or two for the High-Definition DVD format war to play out before I buy a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player. But I've watched standard-definition DVD on my Xbox with this TV, and the picture is beautiful. I'm sure High-Definition DVD would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison, but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition DVD on this TV.     In short, this is an excellent TV, especially compared to other 1080p  models in its size range. If you're looking for something in the range of $2000-$2200, this is the one you want. Enjoy
1 There are over 100 reviews. I am not saying the same thing again. I just throw my rating in.All I can say is... You will be better off if you completely learn how to master this calculator
1 I have been using this mouse at work since it came out. After many miles of use, the scroll wheel has finally started to fail.  I can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls.  The best feature of this mouse is the battery life.  A coworker who swears by his Logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months, but I usually got at least ten months out of mine.  I even took to dating the batteries when I installed them, just to rub it in.This mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some, but overall I would recommend it.Going to try a rechargable Logitech next time around
1 I don't know where the guy below got that this card doesn't work with Windows Media Center Edition because I just installed the latest XP drivers for the card on Media Center Edition 2005 and it works perfectly.  I sold my GIGAPort AG to get this because of the much better signal/noise ratio that the FireWire Audiophile has and it made a big difference.  Very clean sound!  I use it to DJ with using MixVibes, using the ASIO drivers and it works beautifully!  A great buy to say the least... pick one up, you wont regret it
1 We purchased this TV in Dec of 2006.  We are very happy with it.  It was very easy to plug and play...had it ready in no time for holiday... I would definitely recommed it to new buyers
1 It was easy ordering, easy delivery and satisfying outcome. Love the TV
1 Have only used it a couple of times in a month, and feel like I've already justified the low cost. - Should be fine for my intermittent use
1 First off... I like this unit.  It's EASY to use, and it does a fine job of taking your old LPs and making CDs out of them.  All you need to do is place a blank AUDIO CD into the deck (it doesn't work with regular data CDs), hit the phono/aux button, followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the LP... take it out of pause.  It starts recording instantly.  Between each song, hit a button and it break the recording into tracks.  Pretty cool!It's got great potential, but there are still a few shortcomings.  For example, I was surprised to see that it doesn't let you record off of the radio.  Just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner wasn't digital. It's a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations.  You turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago.I wouldn't mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets.  This also makes the remote control somewhat useless too.  Oddly, the remote does have an AM/FM button.  They should just label it the "Radio" button, because when you think of it, switching from AM to FM or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re-tune the station too, using the dial.Another key point is that the unit doesn't have any outputs at all.  So you can't pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers.I would rate this as 3.5 stars, but since we can't use half stars, I'll give it 4 for one big reason.... For all it's shortcomings, it works, and there are very few alternatives.Speaking of alternatives, here are a few other options.1. A standalone CD-Recorder.  I have one of these too.  The advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck.  In my case, my stand alone unit has two drives, so not only can I record from any source in my system, but I can dub from one drive to the other.  Also, my deck can make MP3 CDs from regular CDs (It's easier than using a PC, however the song titles are just numbers).  In my case, I opted not to use this for my LP projects, because I no longer have a turntable.  I decided that as long as I needed a new turntable, I might as well pay a bit more for this unit.2. Crosley makes a simuilar unit, but it costs a bit more and the reviews I read seemed to point out that although it looks better, the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot.3. A portable digital recorder like the iKey Plus.  I found one of these a few weeks ago and I love it.  You plug your turntable or other external source into it... plug a USB storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality (.WAV vs several MP3 sampling rates)... Viola!  It records directly to your flash drive, iPod or external hard drive.  If you do go that route, make sure you get the "Plus" model.  The older model is outdated and doesn't work as well.4. Use a PC.  Even though it will give you the best possible sound and options, it's out of the question for me because I do not want to move my PC near my stereo every time I want to make a recording, nor do I want to move my stereo next to my PC... or bog it down while I'm trying to use it for that matter.Keep in mind that if you record your CDs using one of the stand alone decks, you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the CDs you made into a PC afterwards, then filtering the files with your favorite audio software, then re-burn the files to CD or MP3.
1 Right price and works off of USB!  The sound is terrible on MacBook so this will fill in nicely
1 I bought this cute little speaker from Walmart (14$) and it is so compact and very useful. It also matches with my other speakers of Sony Dream system.This has 4 USB ports (So good when they stay on your desktop rather than on your pC sitiing down the table.). They are lighted, so that you can plug them in even night. Speaker is good quality and it has one USB connection and One DC connection.Quality of sound is good if not excellent. Overall It is a great buy for the price.
1 Works as advertised, I needed longer range and it provided, easy setup, stable connection
1 Fast Service and great price!  Work great for about a mile or so but then I got them for shopping with my wife, she is at one end of the store and I am at the other
1 So I received my Go-510 and expected it to work right out of the box.  It powered up, great windshield adapter, no problems with the connections, bluetooth works perfectly, Ipod controls - no problem.  Just one thing, NO SATELLITE FIX !!  It would not lock on - even after one hour in the open sky.  I thought, here goes....bad tech support....ship it back...But no.  I called tech support, got through to a human (very knowledgable) in only 20 seconds.  Problem was fixed by upgrading firmware and the unit works perfectly.  I read on many sites of the problems plaguing these units.  Apparently, they have all the bugs out because every aspect, every feature is cool and workable.  The TomTom Go-510 is highly recommended in my book and mad props to the tech support crew - way to roll
1 sent quickly and nicely packaged. these will do the job for those desiring a shorter recording program
1 This is my first experience with HDTV and wide screen.  This 46" Sony TV is excellent with HD programs; with regular broadcasts, it is a bit muddy, but that is the fault of the signal, not the TV.  I am very pleased with the overall quality of the set.  I had the set professionally installed and set up, and I am sure glad I did: install and set up are not for amateurs like me; if anything ever happens, I will be hard pressed to reset things.  Sony's instruction manuals are not that great
1 My Panasonic RV31K is five years old this month and after thousands of hours playing movies it works just as well today as when I first took it out of the box. Panasonic makes quality products and just like anything else mechanical you can get a lemon. If this player ever dies (cross my fingers) I will get another Panasonic. I choose mine after reading all of the reviews here and in epinions.co
1 The stick came in an excellent condition, and works perfectly. I recommend this product.
1 I had looked at numerous stands for my Yamaha keyboard and didn't want to spend a ton of money for a professional grade stand (at professional prices).  With that in mind, the Yamaha PKBX2 Double X Portable Keyboard Stand is a good choice at $29.99.  I had seen other stands that were not as sturdy (single X stands)and cost about the same price.Tips for assembly: - Don't read the instructions, just look at the enlarged image of the keyboard on Amazon and assemble the stand the way it's shown.- The bolts for attaching the arms and legs come screwed in to the stand.  Use the (included )Allen Wrench to remove them.PROS:- Low price.- Solid, sturdy stand.- Works for just about any keyboard.- The stand's height is fully adjustable, and can be done in several seconds - without having to unscrew anything.CONS:- There is no way to attach a keyboard to this stand.  No screws, bolts or straps are included, even though most (including my Yamaha) keyboards have pre-drilled holes for screwing the board to a stand.  The keyboard simply sits on top of the stand.  I was VERY disappointed about this.- The included Allen wrench did not work for one of the bolts.  The bolt came screwed in to the stand way too tightly to be removed using the included tool.  The Allen Wrench only stripped the bolt, it did not loosen it.  Luckily my husband had a better Allen Wrench of nearly identical size, and that one worked.  Without it, we would not have been able to loosen the bolt
1 Elegant design, sturdy construction.  Supports my Yamaha SY35 securely.  After reading the forbidding reviews I decided to assemble it without first reading the directions.  It took me 10 min
1 I'm very happy with this device.  The suction cup holds very securly.  I would advise anyone who buys a satellite receiver to skip the adhesive mounting bracket that comes with it, it will come un-stuck eventually.  Just get one of these brackets and mount the radio right in the first place
1 If you like to listen to audio tapes you will like this one. Replacing the provided headphones is a good idea. FM reception a little weak, but the tape play time on ONE AA battery is amazing. Lightweight and good quality for the price
1 By far this is the best printer I've had I been buying epson for many years if you like your pictures to have that pro photo look this the printer to own.The price is great delivery was very quick rec'd it next day.When you buy epson you won't back.
1 Came quickly and was exactly as offered. I am completly satisfie
1 I mean seriously, I'm running a Ubuntu box here. With other card-type things, sometimes I'd have to modify or find drivers and wrappers for some stuff to work - not with this. I just slid it into the computer and WA-BAM - makes my DVD player a bajillion times faster than it was before and just worked out of the box
1 I just purchased the Archos 604 about 3weeks ago. So far so good. It interfaces very easily with the computer. Though I have not tried it using Windows Media 10 yet. I recommend at least buying the Archos Docking Adapter Kit (if you do not plan on using the Archos to record programs). It allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos.The only negative that I have so far is that the volume, at its highlest level, is difficult to hear on an airplane. You may need some noise canceling headphones
1 I ordered this for my teenage daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  The sound is great and the amplifier works well.  For the price it plays like a much more expensive instrument.  I recommend this to any new player wanting to learn the guitar
1 I received a pleasent surprise. The keyboard was shipped sooner than I expected, arrived in perfect condition and works beautifully. I will buy from this vendor again
1 It does work/live with DSL installed on the same line, ever heard of DSL filters? Too small? are you kidding? this phone is great all around
1 The price I paid for this spindle of CD-R's was pretty good and have not had a problem yet. The only price that I have seen that beats this one was Staples running a sale of 50 for $10, but I have yet to use the stock that I bought as I still have about 25 left on the spindle. If you don't want to wait for their sale, this is an excellent bargain. The print surface has done very well with the inks from my Epson Photo R-220
1 The case is nice, but I bought it thinking it would hold my folding keyboard.  It was too small.  The price was great, and the transaction was flawless
1  Compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special CF's with extended bases. Other than that, it can't be beat for the price and quality. Adorama Rocks
1 I enjoyed putting this together. The spacers kinda threw me until I realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf. I got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the DVD shelves weren't spaced properly [CD sized] so I had to take it apart and redo it, but that wasn't too bad. The spacers snap apart easily enough, even for my feeble fingers.  It's not terribly sturdy [maybe I didn't get the poles screwed down tightly enough] but as long as it's in its permanent location, holds the multimedia well. I really like the way it looks. Bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one, too :
1 The AMD Ahtlon 64 Venice processor is great. Installed into my new Gigabyte MB without a hitch and runs very cool. That will give up some room for future overclocking. Overall I would highly recommend the processor. By applying for their credit card, I received a really low price from Amazon which was very surprising. About $170.00 with free shipping and no tax. Everyone else was $200-$230 for the same processor. It is a great CPU at a good price from Amazon
1 I looked at all the different cases for my new iPod with video, and the reviews kept pointing me back to this case.  So I bought it.  it exceeds my expectations.  It's fantastic.My ipod is now completely contained and scratchproof.  This helps when down the road I might want to sell it.The screen cover is perfectly clear and seems very durable.  I like the fact that it's held off of the ipod's screen so it won't scratch.  The clickwheel is easily usable, actually more so because of the circle around it.I bought the case on Amazon from SonicSwap and am astounded at how fast I got it.  2 days! Amazing.This case is for the 60GB iPod with Video.  It clearly says that in the title; not sure how that one reviewer got confused about that.Don't hesitate.  This is THE case
1 I gave my son a Garmin 60C for Christmas last year. Tinkered with it for a couple of days before handing it over. It worked well. Of course I wanted one for myself, but cash is cash, so I've been putting it off. (Side note - I wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring, and when they went to get it, it had been stolen from their car map-pocket. It seems these are high-theft items; keep'em on a short leash.) My wife hadn't gotten me any "big" Christmas gift, so I told her I knew what I wanted, and started shopping. I debated between the eXplorist 500 and 600. Chose the 600, with its altimeter and thermometer. Probably could have lived without them, but hey, it's Christmas!It came yesterday, so I charged it a bit, and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover. I had to go out to the street for the Garmin to find satellites. Took it out for a spin today. Spot-on navigation as I ran errands. It tracked back almost to the exact spot I had marked for home, though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate - so it's off by a few feet. (Maybe it still thinks it's in Britain?)Now - why only 4 stars? 1) the USB connector can attach to the unit either way. There's no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go. I called the 800 # and spoke with someone (in New Delhi) who had heard this a lot. She told me what to do, and the PC immediately recognized the GPS file system - as a removable disk drive, as advertised. I really find their Website information near-zero. Something as elementary as this should be covered on a Website after the 3rd call, eh?2) I bought the Mapsend 3D Topo software. I am interested in elevations. And it has detailed street maps. BUT - they're not routable! If you want routable streets (where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow's flight direct path) for following in a car, then either you have to get both map products, or choose. It's rather frustrating. And the sales information provided on Amazon and the Magellan sites does not make this critical lack very clear. It tells you what you can do, but not what you can't and there's no product comparison to see what the differences are. On the Mapsend Topo box, it says very clearly, "NAVTEQ roads and streets data - like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems (non-routable)". Er, excuse me, then it's not quite like that found in expensive car systems, is it? I concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage (on Amazon and Magellan) more obfuscating than informative. Why can't someone create a simple comparison chart for all the various map packages
1 This card is one of the best, the  graphics are very high! i play games at full specs, needs a big chassis because generates heat, i did bought a TT Armor and my system works better, easy installation.
1 Not a bad product, but has very little bass response and the weather channel does not come in very well, no matter where the antenna is positione
1 I have been using a lot mouses during last years,but this is the best far away from the others.It's very comfortable to use it.....
1 I compared it with low cost Monoprice and high cost Monster cable. I picked up 10' cable for about $70.00 from Amazon few months ago. It's been working pretty well. No complains so far and I like the thinness of cable.
1 This 23" LCD HDTV has excellent image quality and looks really stylish, too.  It also comes with HDMI so you can hook up the latest HD video source such as HD-DVD or Blue-ray hi-def DVD players.  The LCD panel itself displays vivid, evenly-lit images, and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model.I personally ended up opting for the Sharp LD-23SH1U HDTV LCD monitor because the Sharp works as PC/Mac monitor (plus J&R started offering a $[...]rebate).  But I think this Panasonic is a great choice, too, no doubt about that
1 I purchased this so my PC could share a monitor with my XBOX360.  Does the job at a cheap cost!  So easy to use that my 4 yr. old can use it
1 I've had this phone less than a week, but I have been pleased with it's performance so far. The set up was somewhat tricky, as many, if not all Skype addresses use a period in the address. None of the literature showed how to find the period. By accident I noticed it was available on the 1 button. After discovering that, the installation went flawlessly. If one is already familiar with the use of the alpha/numeric keypad, one would have no problems. If one is learning on this phone with the literature provided, one needs help. The phone has worked well with both the landline, and the Skypeout alternatives. I'm pleased enough that I'm buying two more as the equipment will accomodate up to four phones.
1 This is just Great. Lots of storage for data files and pictures. Allows me to keep my file with me where ever I go. No additonal software required, just plug it in the USB Port and you have instant files, fast and easy to use. Small in size but big in storage. I give it 5 stars
1 Code length of this product is very small. I had to buy an extention cord.The sound quality is not bad
1 Turns out I don't like in-ear ear phones.  The sound on these is good, though the bass is a bit much in my opinion.  The in-ear style makes me feel deaf to the outside world.  If you do like this style, these are pretty good.
1 These are the only reliable disks I have found.  I began a collection of Friends on my dvd-rws.  I have over 25 disks full so far and only had minimal problems with 1 or 2 disks.  I rewatch all my favorite episodes, of which I have over 100 and have no problems.  These are the best
1 with over 3 hours recording time,these are great. I use them for meetings. No problems or errors
1 To my eyes, the printer's rendition of colors is above average. It isn't horrible but neither is it the best. Pricewise it's an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature. We've been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via Tray 2 (the default paper supply) and haven't any problems. The manual (electronic file) advises "Never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels." So it's a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label. A wonderful quality of experience is the near "instant on" (very minimal warmup) feature and it's quiet. My previous Okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing. Its time delay was also a disadvantage. I think most people will be very happy with the HP.[...
1 I got the Canon CP400 printer a while back so I could make the occasional print to hand out (or put silly captions on "bad" Christmas party photos).I don't know how the printer manages to keep the image aligned as the paper goes in and out 4 times (yellow, magenta, blue, and the clear coat) but when it drops it out, I have a pretty nice print, complete with address lines and a stamp outline on back (plus Canon logo of course) - suitable for mailing as a postcard. About 1/2" of each end gets removed  after printing as it is used for traction of the rubber roller in the printer.I frequently print 3 shots vertically on a 4 x 6 card as sort of a mini proof sheet. I've also used the 4 x 8 size to print 2 side by side.Fun stuff
1 This is a great printer for those who want to print on 12x12 scrapbook pages. It works well with heavier(cardstock) paper. It also prints great photos. I have a MAC i-book. I also use The Print Shop 2 program with it. It gives me great versatility with my pages & photos
1 My criteria for my new printer purchase was:1. 11x172. individual inks3. reliable printer company4. easy installation/good customer service5. price (this was a bit pricey but the next step up was not a choice)So far for my needs this has been a great printer so far.  It does great quality prints for photos, school projects and more.  I wanted to have more versatility to make posters, labels, photos, etc...  My last HP wide format printer (1200c) lasted for over 5 years and I took it everywhere.  I have only had this for a few motnhs but it hasn't been a disappointment yet

1 Its a great graphics card, especially for the price. I got it to improve Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and it did. But the controls arent as clear as they could be for the anti-aliasing settings and the anisotropic filtering
1 The only thing I will say about the BDP-S1 is that it is top quality.Picture and sound quality are top-notch, but everything really depends on the software.Now, if you are undecided about which camp to follow (Blu-ray or HD DVD), I'm here to tell you that Blu-ray will win.You see, I have both Blu-ray and HD DVD.I have about 20 HD DVD movies and about 20 Blu-ray movies. In terms of picture and sound quality, they are the same, but it is completely dependant on the software.But here is where the similarities end.1) Blu-ray is more durable. The BD movie discs have scratch-resistant coating. They don't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them.On the other hand, the HDDVD movies scratch like heck. I put all of my movies in a CD case. I recently noticed that ALL the HDDVD movies are scratched, but NONE of the Blu-ray movies are scratched. These are stored in the SAME CD case by me. I am extremely careful. None of my movies even have a fingerprint on them. So when I see scratches on 100% of my HDDVD movies, that really upsets me!!!!!2) Blu-ray costs less to BUY.What? Superman Returns BD is $24, Superman HDDVD is $28. The Departed BD is $24, The Departed HDDVD is $28.Now the HDDVD DUAL format has both a standard DVD and HDDVD movie, but who in their right mind would want to buy an HDDVD to watch a 480p picture? Right now you can get a $500 PS3 or $400 Toshiba HDDVD player. Later this year, Sony will come out with a $300 Blu-Ray disc player. HDDVD will most likely drop their prices. So the hardware will cost the same in both formats.3) Blu-ray has more capacity.For less money, you can get a 50GB Blu-ray movie versus a 30GB HDDVD movie.And what if in 5 years they develope SUPER High-Definition 1920p picture and SUPER Hi-Def 8.1 DTS-HD Sound? What if this requires 75GB or 100GB?HDDVD can go up to 51GB.Peace.
1 So far, so good!  Only takes up 1U in our rack. This product arrived in good shape and on time.  Setup was a breeze.  Right now we only have 2 servers connected to it, but switching between them is no problem, so I don't foresee a problem when we add 4 more.-Kevi
1 I hva tried alll kinds of stuff on the iPod, and this is th eonly one that got rid of all the scratches. Thanks for a  fantastic product
1 I can't remember when I felt so good about an online purchase.  The product is more than I expected for the money and the quick service just awed me!  I will definately be doing business through AMAZON many, many more times in the future!  THANK YOU
1 Use original Epson Brand ink, the heads in the epson printers it's in the printer itself not in the ink cartridge, it dosent worth saving some dollars and ruing the printer
1 I bought this printer to print my shipping labels faster. It's easy to use! It prints very fast.Print quality is excellent. Changing diferent type of labels is easy too. I highly recommend this printer
1 Everything about the Sonos worked as advertised.  It was a snap to set up and it is slicker than I anticipated.  The interface is commonsense and well thought out.  It is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously.  You can also play different music, all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio.   It is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises
1 The XMB-10 is a great way to listen to my XM Audiovox receiver at home. The boombox is slightly larger than I desired, but the sound is great, it's easy to use, lightweight, very portable and nice looking.
1 I agree with the comments posted here.  Like most of us, I was interested in the Bose sound yet put off by the prestige price.  Even on E-Bay the going price ended up being around $400 -- for a used older model.  So I did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison-shopper article that put the Bose up against several competitors, including this high-end TEAC.  I have to say that I'm entirely satisfied.The chrome retro look is quite appealing, and the model has a couple of features that, for me, beat out Bose entirely.  I wanted a top-loading door like the old Bose models but also the ability to play MP3 like the new ones, and this gave me both.  The sound and punch is remarkable.  At flat setting, it is a bit bassy, that's true, but you get a -5 to+ 5 range for both bass and treble adjustment: I set mine at -3 and +1 respectively and am very happy with the sound in my bedroom.  Input and alarm functions are limited but not problematic.  10 presets can be cycled though quickly enough, and just remember to set it to a station (or load a CD) that you'd want to be woken up to before calling it a night!TEAC customer service I can't comment on, but I bought a reconditioned unit from an Amazon seller for less than $100, including shipping.  A sweet deal for a sweet machine.
1 I didn't want to fork over 500 for a BOSE or Boston Acoustics, or even 350 for a Cambridge Soundworks, and then I found this little gem, for about 175 + shipping.  I've had it for a few days, and so far I am impressed.The SX  functions are very intuitive, easy to set the time and both alarms.  I thought it was extremely innovative to have the button that sets the time located inside the CD player compartment, no more accidentally changing the time instead of the alarm!  The alarm buttons themselves will illuminate when they are activated, which is great.  The buttons themselves have a nice click when you press them, and the CD, AM/FM tuner, and AUX buttons will glow when they are active.  The volume control and tuner knobs are recessed, but this keeps the player from having any unsightly bulges I suppose.  The snooze/sleep button is a good size.  The sleep function can be toggled for 90, 60, or 30 minutes.The range of the speakers is great when you consider the size of the SX.  The speakers measure about 2.5 inches, and with the volume turned up, you can definitely feel the air being pushed out of the bottom of the unit.  I like that it has adjustable bass and treble, which can vary from -5 to +5.  I have the bass set to +3 and treble to +2 and it sounds great.  It doesn't have the range of say a home entertainment system, but definitely rivals my Sony bookshelf system.The MP3 player on the SX could be better, but is adequate.  During playback, the LCD will scroll to display the filename, title, artist, and track.  It can be programmed for up to 64 tracks, but I haven't had the time or patience for this.  Instead, I just numbered the MP3 tracks in the order I wanted before burning them to the CD-rom.  The repeat function works well, and you can choose either to repeat one track, repeat all tracks, or repeat just one folder.  However, the shuffle function is rather limited, as it has only one setting which is to randomly play an MP3 from any of the folders (resulting in less than desired combinations of music), and it stop playing music after each song from all the folders has been played once.One of the things I looked for in a clock radio is an auxilliary input mini-jack, and it also has a jack for headphones.  I have my laptop on my nightstand right now, and it playing MP3s on winamp sound great plugged into the SX.There are only 2 levels of brightness for the backlit LCD.  The default level cannot be changed or dimmed, and is rather bright in a dark room.. it will make everything glow.  Takes a little while to get used to, but is not say brighter than a typical nightlight I guess.  It is a bit hard to read at night because the numbers are so small, and the brightness of the LCD can kind of drown out the analog display, but then again I wear glasses so I suppose I have nothing to blame besides my bad eyes.  When the radio or CD player is in operation, the dial becomes significantly brighter but it can be toggled to the lower/default level with the dimmer button on the remote control.One other thing about the unit was the lack of a battery backup, and you will notice this is the case with many Japanese units, including the Sony clock radios.  I guess the power grid in Japan is really stable, so they don't have use for this, but still, it would be nice if there was an option for a backup 9 volt battery.  On the other hand, I was informed by TEAC tech support that the unit does contain a capcitor which will retain the time and alarm for "up to 3 hours".  I haven't had the time to test the maximum threshold, but I can say that I did unplug the clock for about a minute, and when I plugged it back in, sure enough the time and alarms were still correct.Overall I am really impressed by this unit.  The only thing that could be better is if the MP3 player shuffle had a few more options, but I guess this is ok as many I have seen MP3 clock radios without any shuffle function at all!  Also, I wish the LCD backlight could be adjusted a little more.  It is a bit pricey at just under 200, but I have heard many clock radios, and you would have to spend 350+++ to get anywhere near the sound quality of the TEAC SX
1 I got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it.  The unit is beautifully designed, fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small.  My only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong.  I live in a tough area for reception, and there's slight static on my favorite stations.  The FM antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit, but the reception is still not totally clear.That being said, I'm glad I got it, and when my wife's happy, I'm happy
1 This is an excellent power conditioner and voltage stabilizer,all in one.This unit  can protect your sensitive high end audio system,computers,and video moniters,from....Everyday,power surges,power sags,over voltages,and brown-outs.These surges,  pick away at your sensitive equipment..taking years off their useful life...i own and highly recommend,this unit
1 I've had HP and Lexmark printers in the past.  This Canon outshines both of the other brands.  It is super easy to install WITHOUT any troubleshooting.  Works like a charm.  The prints looks great
1 I use my LX4 2.1 system as my desktop PC speakers. I got this recommendation from Maximum PC, since the LX4 5.1 system was 2005's best speaker system. You can view their gear of the year review here: http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/12/m-audio_studiop_1.html. Being skeptical of a $550 5.1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite, I wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2.1 system. As soon as I purchased cables (FYI: no 1/8" stereo to two 1/4" mono cables seem to exists -as far as I've seen--, so you have to use adaptors) I was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the speakers. I wasn't used to speakers with crossovers, where only the each type of speaker (tweeter, woofer, and sub) gets the right frequencies, so no overlapping exists. All the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient, while the speakers themselves are of superb build quality. After only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound-intensive games, I immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5.1 expander setup.If you are looking for speakers that play really loud, or can fill a living room with the desired feel for an action movie, these are not for you. But if you want incredibly accurate PC speakers or relatively cheap studio monitors this is definitely the setup for you. You will not be disappointed if you buy the LX4 for your bedroom or for computer use
1 Amazing sound comes from these tiny inexpensive headphones. The different size buds are very comfortable and help produce the deep bass sound once you find the pair the fit your ear. when I first got them I put the smallest buds on first and thought I had just bought the worst headphones. So I tried the largest buds and found they fit very comfortably and because of the seal they created in my ears they acted as an air tight bass box improving the sound ten fold.And just let you know I ussualy cant wear earbud headphones because they hurt my ear holes or they just don't fit righ
1 I reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as I haven't authored or copied very many DVDs with it yet.  However, what I have accomplished with it is commendable.  I can copy an entire commercial DVD (Movie + all the extras) under 50 minutes.  I have composed a Slide show DVD with my own MP3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it.So far, no coasters.  I am now in the process of producing DVDs of my old 8mm home movies.  The converter is giving me more problems than anything.  Still recommend the PX-755UF for anyone interested in an external burner.  Installation was a snap (plug-n-play)
1 These fit over everything very well, and they stayed put without stretching out, which is why my original pads fell off.  I guess it's one of those products that you can't do much better than $10 for, but maybe they could give you double the number of pads or something..
1 I would give a high recommendation for this TV.  It is the perfect size for a bedroom especially if you're not looking to overwhelm the room but you just want something to watch a late night movie, the morning or evening news, or the late shows in high def.  DVD player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the TV at all.  The picture is outstanding and isn't that what really matters in the end??!!  The only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation - the TV has an auto-on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a channel on which to tune the TV once it goes on.  It you are use the HDMI as I am to get signal from your cable box, you must have the TV input mode set to HDMI but you can't set the auto-on to the HDMI input (it must be a channel number).  The engineers just didn't think that one through all the way.  Oh well, still a great TV
1 Got this drive a few weeks ago for an Apple Power Mac G4 Cube.The G4 Cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious.  Thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed.  This drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is.  Unbelievable.  Don't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep.Disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6-8 inches from the Cube and is totally non-existent more than 12 inches from the Cube.Will not hesitate to buy Seagate Barracuda drives for all future machines.The 5-year warranty is a winner.Highly recommend this drive for its silence, speed, cost and warranty
1 I used these speakers (4) as part of my 7.1 channel theater and I used the HTI 55 Center channel plus the HTI 8" Ceiling to finish off my system.  I have a Denon 2307CI pumping these speakers and let me tell you, I can't even crank up the system to the highest as these speakers ROCK my entire house FROM THE BASEMENT!!!  These are the best in wall SPEAKERS I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!!!!  Buy them now before they're all gone!Highly recommend
1 The chip works just as advertised.  I have had no problems with it, it was easily formatted to my Kodak camera, and it stores a huge amount of pictures and video, either about 280 pictures or almost an hour of video.  Great product, I would recommend it for anyone looking for a lot of storage space for a good price
1 We now have three of the K850 printers in use, one with a built in print server, second paper tray, and duplexer.  So far, the printers have proved to be reliable, fast, and comparatively inexpensive to operate.  Power on, pre-print, and post-print noise may be objectionable to users who are located close to the printer.Capable of using the same HP 10 black and HP 11 individual color ink cartridges, as well as replacement print heads as the HP Business Ink Jet 1100d and HP Business Ink Jet 1200d, the K850 shares the same low, per page operating cost as the 1100d and 1200d printers.  Full page color photographs print in roughly 32 seconds, with a roughly eight second delay prior to the start of printing; similar prints from other printers may require from one to five minutes to print the same full page color photograph.  White horizontal lines were present in the full page color photograph, possibly indicating that one or two of the nozzles in the print heads, shipped with the new printer, are defective.The printer handles paper sizes up to 13" x 19", so it easily handles B size (tabloid, 11" x 17") paper commonly used for small engineering prints and foldable newsletters.  The printer software installs without problem, although a reboot will likely be required.  For network capable K850 printers, the software install automatically finds K850 printers on the network, and adds a "HP Standard TCP/IP Port" to the computer configuration for communication with the printer.  For non-network capable K850 printers, both USB and parallel port connections are supported.Positives:* Uses ink that is compatible with other printer models, helping to keep operating costs down.* Fast printing for full page color, and even faster black printing with spot color.* Large format color printing, which is helpful for quick generation of engineering prints.* Nearly idiot proof print cartridge replacement - light turns on to indicate the color that needs to be replaced, printing stops automatically, user replaces ink cartridge, and printing continues.* Separate ink cartridges and print heads means less aligning of print cartridges/heads after ink cartridge replacement, larger capacity ink cartridges, and lower operating cost.Negatives:* Minimal install of HP software from the CD requires at least 100MB.* Low capacity HP 13 print cartridges ship with the printer.* Power-on, pre-print, and post-print noise, just like the Business Ink Jet 1100d and 1200d.  However, there is very little noise produced while printing.* Cheap plastic cover over the print cartridges, similar to that used on the 1200d.* Large footprint
1 Works great.Had to remove the brown plastic fitting from the antenna wire that encased the actual metal connector to the cradle.Other reviews pointed this out so it wasn't a big deal, just had to be done carefully.
1 Everything works great. The only marginal issue is that the batteries don't last a full eight hours. It works in the car but cuts in and out.Guess I have to break down and buy the car kit
1 I bought this mount for a philips 42" plasma TV.  The TV weighs probably about 100LBs.  I thought the price for it was OK, but i don't know how much an average mount would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other mounts.    The mount was put on our living room wall by a "handy man" because i didn't have a stud finder.  He was able to to put the mount on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic.  The mount sits very well secured and the frame of the mount is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured.  The 5o tilt function is very nice to have and is being used so the TV sits a little high, but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house.  The room for the input cables is a little small, and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but haven't noticed any degradation in the signal.  None of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way, so its not of a concern.  I took the cables and made a 1" "trunk" of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories.  The TV sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o tilt.  I rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong.  It also looks nice and stays well hidden.  Its features with the 5o tilt work great and the locking bar makes removing the TV easy(I had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables).  I am very very happy with it and would definitely recommend this product
1 I bought this product to hang a 42" LCD.I am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns.  The mount is only 32" wide.  The "virtual axis" tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me.  There are only two tilt options with this mount, vertical (hugs wall nicely) and the 5 degree.  Being 32" wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16" centers.  Make sure you get at least 2 studs.  My experience is this mount does not support VESA 400x800mm pattern.  800mm is ~31.5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than ~30 apart.  My TV did have another attaching pattern but I had to use the M5 bolts (provided with mount).  I would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where I could use the thicker M8 bolts.  A 42" LCD isn't going to weigh as much as a 50"+ TV, so take that into consideration.  I am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy.
1 My dad and I installed it in just an hour!  It was very.  You can't beat this price.  I found the same mount at Best Buy for over $200!!! 
1 Great soundcard!  I noticed in Battlefield 2142 that I can hear the sounds of footsteps behind me better.  I'm not getting knifed as often (which is a very good thing!)  I'm glad I got this card
1 This is absolutely the best mp3 i have ever owned. What makes it the best?1. 16 million color 2.5 LCD touchscreen. 2. Battery life is too good to be true. 52 hours audio 10hr video.3. The best sound, it has how much tweaks, its sick. You can slowdown a song or make it sound like the chipmunks. Has BBE,Wide stereo, enhancement stereo etc.4. The volume is sooo dam loud. I had a Zune and the volume level was at 20, the lourdest it could go. The D2 level is 50 and at 30 it sounds as high as the zune.5. You can encode AVI video bitrate at 1.5mbps.Also have WMV which you can encode at 768kbps.6. No need to install to transfer files, it works like a USB flash drive.7. You can change backgrounds and if you put a black background and your text is black, you can change the text color to 20 difference colors or make you own.8. The touchscreen is smooth and flawless. WHen playing music it tells you the info of the file. example bitrate info, Hz etc. Something that is lacking on the big boys. 9. Has tv output, also has a recorder to record conversations.10. Can view .txt files.11. Can view pics at very high pixels.12. Fm tuner, you can record from the FM radio. You can set the bitrate from low to 256kbps.13. Has a SD slot for more storage. Get a 8 gig SD for a total for 12 gig. Imagine in 2 years when they have 20 gig SD.14. Great support, firmware updates are always available.Plus sooo much more
1 This particular Cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it, it will blow you away.  I've heard people complain about Dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support, autually their tech support sucks but I don't need them.  This is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully.  When you actually learn how to use it, you won't buy anything else for the price.  If you are tech savey, you will really enjoy the product.  I have nine cams installed at three locations.  Using their IP software you can view upto 16 at once.  The reason I'm back, on this site, is because I need to order two more.  I did have to return my first one but it was a pre-production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear.  Dlink sent my replacement direct.  The oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now.  One last comment, the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50% more with less features
1 I like this printer.  There a few minor quarks, but it's fast and the prints come out good.  The one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight.  If it's lose it will start making bad prints.  It takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out, tighten it and start printing again.I am also using this with the Mac OSX OS.  Though the device says it will only work with PC and mentions something about the CASIO CW Utility for use on a Mac, but no where on the Casio site could I find the mentioned Utility.    After some searching I cam e accross this:[...]This allows the CW-100 to work fine on a Mac.  Though I have never seen the  PC software that comes with printer, I have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options. This is enough to get around, since you can make a JPG version of your label, put that in the print area and print away.  The JPG can be what ever image/text you want.  Resolution is great too.  I print at 300dpi.All in all, I found this to be a great purchase.  I make music and do not have the money to send out to have my CDs done.  This print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost.  Great the DIYer
1 If you're an anti-commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over.  If however you don't like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard AM/FM you might like this tuner. Many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting HD signals.  The quality of HD is most amazing on quiet passages in Classical music, there is no noise at all, very quiet. You do notice!  The HDT-1 is quite sensitive. It will pull in stations that other tuners won't, and I'm not even talking about the HD2 streams that the stations are starting to feature. Clear Channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with HD.  Their stations sound good and most of the FM's are doing HD2, a few have some interesting formats not heard on most AM/FM stations.  I hope the get even more adventurous. My only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get HD to lock in on AM or FM.  I don't believe that to be a fault of the tuner, it's the HD system and just like FM did I'm sure it will improve (ask someone over 50 about FM drift) .  I give it 5 stars, it's not perfect but for the price it's very good and for a first generation product I don't think it could be better than this
1 This is a great little power strip that allows me to maximize the contents of my briefcase. One of the most useful things I have ever bought for business travelling. Very well made. I would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive
1 Very solid, nice looking shelf, easy to assemble with good instructions and all required pieces included.  It's exactly as I expected it
1 I have been enjoying these speakers outside by my pool for several months now, and the quality of the sound is excellent, particularly given the reasonable price.  I'm sure you can get better performance, but it will cost much more.  These speakers are a rare find in today's business world -- something that is actually a good deal...
1 I must admit, the first review posted here on the D320 mademe a little nervous.  My experience is quite different, andafter several months of ownership I am quite pleased.I'll give a point by point rebuttle to the initial review, asthat's the only point of reference (so far):1) Yes, pick up a USB cable,2) Printer driver installation on Win98 essentially required no   user intervention.  With WinXP however, I do seem to recall   having to muck with it more, but I'm hazy on the details now,3) I have printed scores of multi-page documents, many over 15   pages without any problems whatsoever.  I've had no spills   or jams of any kind,4) I have not seen any "paper-curl" problems whatsoever,  5) I leave the paper cassette lid/manual-feed slot in place at   all times as I have no problem with it.  For doing many   two-sided copies, it is indeed easier to place the copies   back into the paper cassette.  But that's my experience with   any copier I've used.6) Making two-sided copies is easy and as efficient as I   expected.  I've simply experienced no problems.7) I've experienced no copier caused misalignments.  If my    copies have been crooked, it was because I set them on the   glass improperly.I am very happy with this unit.  It copies as I expect it to, and prints just the same: quickly and without event.  It's beenable to properly print from all Windoze applications I've thrownat it, and ones many users may not even be using, such asGhostscript, Acrobat, SecureCRT, PAF, and all image viewingsoftware I've tried.  And I've got several machines networkedtogether (Win98 and WinXP) that can all print to the D320 fineusing printer sharing.BTW, the D320 comes with a full, 3500 page toner cartridge too,not a starter unit as with some printers/copiers
1 I struggled between this and the shure e2c. I decided on the e2c, after comparing also with the etymotics r6i and the ultimate ears superfi3. This one has the least clarity, but wonderful bass. If I don't listen to as much classical music, I'd definitely pick vmoda vibe. It makes even terrible pop songs sound cool.I had to reject it because wearing it was not comfortable for my left ear at all for some reason, and I had an extremely hard time putting it in, even with the help of my bf. The vmoda did not come with any foam, only the silicon ear pieces. I settled on the less bass but more clarity and more comfortable e2c
1 This is by far the best radio I've ever had for singing in the shower.  No more fumbling and messing with the dial while I've got soap in my eyes... 10 fm presets, 5 am presets and 5 tv presets + weather, I'm always able to find something good to listen to.  It works great for when I'm out in the yard doing some work as well. 
1 The maps are good enough for navigation of streets and outdoor adventures.  It allows downloading tracks and waypoints from the GPS, editing them and saving to files or the GPS.  It is annoying to have to put the last CD in your drive to use the program
1 I was programming an Ipod for a friend and became interested in buying one for myself.  I went to the store to get some info on the Ipod, and luckily the departments store I frequent didn't carry the unit, but offered the Zune.  I came straight home, did my reasearch, and ordered on the same day.  The Zune is far more superior than any Ipod model that I have either read about or experienced for myself.  And a much better deal moneywise.  I must say that you shouldn't get a Zune unless you are running a Windows version with SP2 or higher, for any other ver. won't recognize the unit.  I had a pc w/SP1 and Media Center 2002, so I thought I was in trouble.  Against my initial thoughts on SP2, I went ahead and upgraded, and haven't had any problems yet.  The sound is great, videos are decent, and the software is very user friendly.  I would check out the other models of media players, especially the Archos brand, for they have a bigger screen and hard drive.  But for audio and a few videos, this unit is worth the money
1 I recently purchased the item and knew that some assembly was required. I didn't know that I would be soldering components onto a printed circuit board. That's OK. I was an electronic technician in a former life but it might pose a problem to who might purchase this item expecting a snap together kit
1 I've had these earphones for about two month and I've discovered the following.  I like the look and they seem to be well made.  The only grip I have is that they are not very loud.  
1 I love the sound quality and the way I am able to exercise and not notice that I have headphones on.  The headphones don't slide but I have had some difficulty adjusting them for a more snug fit.  Overall, well worth the money
1 Great product but is only $30 at iriver.com's stor
1 This is my second set of Garmin radios.  I have had the 120's for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530's.First of all I really like the new color screen and the added features.  The altimeter has been upgraded over the 120's and seems to be more accurate.  My old 120's sitting right next to each other would display different altitudes.  I would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models.  We do a quite a bit of skiing an the altitude displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied. Especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top.The new compass is also helpful.  With the older models you would have to be moving for the compass to work right.  After calibrating the new compass (turning in a circle) it will work just like a regular compass.  I still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup, but the compass on the 530 works great and has not let me down.  You can also route off the compass by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go. The 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and can't see your next way point.As with all the Rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side.  I really think it's because of the waterproofing that they do.  If you don't put it close to your mouth when speaking it's really not that bad.  I did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications.Lock up problem.  I have experienced this once or twice the first time I used them.  I did the Garmin update and have not had the problem since.Overall these new 530's are GREAT.  I have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week.  Now that I have 4 of these (2 120's and 2 530's) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group.  Looking forward to the ski slopes this winter.  We always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours.If you do a lot of outdoor activities or any Geocaching with more than one person these are perfect!![...]
1 I had researched for a long time before I finally made my purchase. The final reasons for this purchase was the Consumer Reports Best Buy recommendation for the larger 42" version of this Olevia set. I had debated about purchasing a TV with 1080 but decided against doing so when I read that in a set this size that the naked eye could not tell the difference between 1080 and 720. I needed the 37" set due to the entertainment center we already owned, which cost 2.5 times the price of the TV, so it wasn't leaving the house. The TV opening would have allowed a 40" but I am glad I stayed with the 37" because the set-up would have been difficult if not impossible with a 40" because of the need to turn the set at angles. I compared the two TVs at the Olevia site and the only difference was the speakers. I also saw the Olevia at a friend's house and was impressed with the quality. The best price was found through Amazon.com. I placed my order on a Friday evening and the set was delivered by UPS in perfect condition on Wednesday. The set-up of the TV was simple. The only problem I experienced was with the remote. Here's the good news: I sent an email to tech support and quickly I had an answer that was simple to follow and the remote worked perfectly the same evening that I set-up the TV. Even though I use the surround sound through our stereo, I actually was satisfied with the sound through the TV speakers. A small problem is that the Time Warner Cable Box remote control does not operate the TV, so we do have to use multiple remotes, but that's only a minor inconvenience. Our family has been very pleased with the TV. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone purchasing this size TV.
1 There is not a lot to this device. Simply plug the wire that comes with it into your yamaha amplifier and receiver and away you go. The ipod gets charged, and on my receiver I can even select the song to play via the on-screen GUI on the TV
1 It is very small and looks very cool.you can charge it very fast.ts sound is very good too.t has radio function too
1 I purchased the transmitter because I don't have an aux input in my car. The product works well.  I live in an area that is crowded with stations and the transmitter still provided a strong enough signal to override weak stations and provide near quality audio.One review mentioned the Sansa player won't fit in the transmitter with the silicon case on. I use the silicon case to protect my player.  I took off the belt clip that comes with the case.  The player and case fits well enough in the transmitter. 
1 This CD/DVD holder is sturdy and stylish.  I needed something to look nice, but hold my stuff, and those wallet-type options weren't really cutting it for me.  I had also purchased something similiar (not Case Logic) from another store and was unimpressed by how flimsy it was.I now have 4 or 5 of these and they look great all lined up.  I plan on getting more as needed.  When they get full, it still stays sturdy and fits in the holder (the other one I purchased ballooned out and had to be forced to get it in).The only con I can think of is the price.  For me, it's worth it, but that may not be the case for you if there are budget constraints
1 I purchased this item on March 15 from Amazon. We've been using it for almost a month now. My wife and I have built our HT system in our Master bedroom (16x14x10) also have 40" Samsung LCD 4095 (1080p) and Polk audio speakers (in ceiling) LC60i for front and middle speakers and RC60i for the surround speakers. I'm awaiting for Toshiba HD-XA2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity  subwoofer with a HSU STF-2 sub.Originally my first choice was a Pioneer VSX-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and HDMI video pass-thru only. I didn't think it fit our needs. However, Onkyo TX-SR604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations, ease of use (very easy setup) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound. I did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to HDMI issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and I didn't mind running extra component cable to my TV knowing it doesn't up-convert component to HDMI. The only thing that I haven't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature. I'm planning to install my extra pair RC60i in wall speakers to our master bathroom hopefully soon so can't comment on that part yet.Overall we're very pleased with our purchased Thanks AMAZON!
1 I've used everything from Ableton Live to ProTools to Reason and this thing is just plug and play.  Very easy interface makes for no brainer recording.  I'm a guitarist and the stock sound selections are outstanding.  Most players drive themselves crazy tweaking their sound but as you know it's all about the SONG.  The Sessions software is a piece of cake and makes it incredibly easy to go with your inspiration instead of getting sidetracked trying to figure out all the bells and whistles.  Fantastic product guys and for the money it's a steal
1 I had an Optoma H27 but felt it was lacking the brightness I liked on TV, and I heard that HD72 was much better.  So I returned my H27 to Costco and got the HD6800, which is Costco's version of the HD72.  Wow, "much better" hardly describes it!  The brightness is incredible, and the detail and colors are truly remarkable.  The other night, I was trying out different DVDs just to see what they looked like on the new system, and I was totally blown away.While it does upscale DVD images to look better on its system, I also bought a Sony upscaling DVD player and there is a significant improvement with it with the HDMI connection.  I had read that since they are both upscaling, the DVD player's upscaling wouldn't be necessary, but I do find the image through the upscaling DVD the best in a side-by-side test using two Sony DVD players and two DVDs of the recently restored "Carousel" using component, s-video, and HDMI at the same time, all connected to the HD72.  I saw clearer detail on faces coming from the HDMI upscaling DVD player.  I was so impressed, I felt like pulling in people from the street to see it, but I fought the impulse because I don't want to share it with anyone.  With a little tweaking of the menus, new films like "Star Wars III" and "Sin City" showed incredible detail, and older films like "The Adventures of Robin Hood" were gorgeous in their Technicolor glory.I highly recommend the HD72.
1 This is just great for a single VPU video card, the cooling system works great, moving all the hot air outside the CPU. The software overclock is good too, u can change values any time u want and u can select if u want those applied for 3D games only.It works with any game, I've tested it with Oblivion at 1280x1024, HDR enabled and every option at maximum. It works great with F.E.A.R at 1280x1024 with AAx8 and FFA x 4the price is good for a very high end video cards
1 Unless that I made an order for Terk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A/V Distribution System, I received another wireless system from TERK Co, but the point is that this system is working properly, and right now I'm able to have Greek TV via internet to my desktop, and via the TERK wireless system downstairs to my living-room TV appliance. During the operational time, I saw that I don't have good resolution. I don't know if the reason is because this distance between my office and my living-room (the office is above from the living-room - so there is no big distance at all).But anyway, I will track this equipment, and if everything is ok I will buy one receiver more.Thank you. 
1 I have purchased over two dozen of these units. This is the best unit for the price. There are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit. This allows you to be certain that your feed is being input. Also the card slots are a plus. Two things to be aware of. If you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use. Apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in. Also if  you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required. Not a one disc does all unit
1 Works as billed.  I am currently playing a DVD+RL that would not play on any other player.  I have not purchased a 1080P LCD TV, but it is why I purchased an upconverting DVD player.  I have tried DVD+R and DVD+RW.  I will be trying audio formats later.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is waiting for the HD versus BlueRay to determine which will be the dominant technology and for its price to come down
1 They are great for putting DVD's, CD's in.  They arrive in great condition
1 I'm not a serious piano player, just casual.  Don't have room for a piano, so this serves my purposes.  I just want to entertain myself.  If I were a professional who played in public, not sure if this would be the ultimate keyboard, because it doesn't have a fullsize keyboard.  But for practicing and casual playing it's great!  It has more features than I will ever use
1 This is exactly what I was looking for: not too expensive, not much hassle with the cables - they are integrated with the unit, and no need to reach for the button to switch computers - simply press "Scroll Lock" twice to go from one computer to the other. Cables are pretty long, which is good: longer that I need at the moment, but I may appreciate the extra length in the future.
1 Great features with the Microsoft mouse.  Wanted at least a 4 button mouse so internet travel is much easier. Comes with a USB dongle that I did not want to use so I was determined to get this mouse working with the built-in Bluetooth in my new Dell Latitude notebook.  Found that the Toshiba drivers provided by Dell for the Bluetooth would not work with the Microsoft mouse.  Seems still some incompatibility with different manufactures of Bluetooth devices.  Go figure....  Had to delete the Toshiba drivers and let XP with SP-2 provide the drivers and it works great. Pros: Great features, no cord, long battery life between charges (days), very responsive.Cons:  Some difficulty getting it to work without supplied dongle, bigger than I like to pack around for a notebook.
1 A great and economical replacement! This product saved me a lot of money. The red in the color leaked a tiny bit in shipment but cleaned up and worked with no problem
1 The Azden transmitter-receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews. As an aspiring video maker it was a product I should have bought a long time ago. Mine is the 9v-powered model, not the AA. But it has proven well-made, light and easy to use. There's something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit. I find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping.  Being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience. Another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise. The din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion; using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information. 
1 It works very well.  It's nice to be able to listen to CD's in my car without getting a whole new stereo system installed.  My only problem is that the CD player will turn off every once in a while when the power cord is bent.  This happens rarely, but it's enough to be a little annoying.  Other than that, it's a very nice product.  No skipping, easy to use and a fair price
1 I got this product when I first signed up to Telewest Broadband and it has never failed. I have had it for 2 years and not a problem. I started at 512kbps and they've upgraded me to 4Mbps and it handles that speed without a problem. Perfect for your light, moderate or heavy user, good all-rounder.Thanks for reading :
1 This product has good and bad points. I listed some below:Good---------Cheaper than Apple ($5 as compared to $30)Works greatSmallConvienientBad---------Cheap (might not hold up long term)No warranty coverage for your iPod is something goes wrongHas to be plugged in upside down (for me anyway...)Overall, I'm glad I bought this instead of Apple's version. The main factor for me was price, but if you have the money, get the Apple charger, simply because you'll be covered by warranty that way
1 Just make sure you buy the right drive for your computer and download the software from Western Digitals website you should have no problems.Very nice
1 I love this remote.I was afraid that having a NON-TIVO brand unit (Toshiba brand TIVO unit) would require lots of setup (testing dozens of codes before finding the right one).Mine worked just as soon as I put batteries into the unit.The buttons are quite intuitive; I never used the user's manual yet.A real winner.An inexpensive replacement for the real unit
1 We installed this external HD on a Dell computer. As most Dell customers will attest to, any time you talk to one of their representatives, they'll deny compatability with anything other than a Dell product. Well, I have upgraded the video card, power supply, and now added this HD to the computer with very liitle effort. This HD has performed perfectly for us.
1 When I got my hands on the PMC-120 I thought this was going to to be the best player but when I started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way.I agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation-device feel to it. MUSIC:When I tried to put music in my PMC it syncronized  my mp3s with the WMP 10 with no problem (very fast). If U are looking for a grab and drop (copy/paste) your music mp3 device, this is not for you because when I did  it got everything in one same folder that read "Unknown artist and album". So you have to put all your mp3s via WMP 10, wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast. The problems that I encountered is that it only has one "Portable playlist"  and sometimes when Im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button.One cool thing is that it shows the cd covers  without having to put them in. This is done via the WMP10.The sound is very good and crisp, and the equalizer setups are fair.But you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound.PICTURES:This is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders. You can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a PC to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you.VIDEO:Ok, now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me...I wanted a portable media device that I would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid.  I knew that this device only reads WMV but it "supports" DIVX, XVID, MPEG, etc. This "support" deppends on what the WMP10 can play. So this means that you sincronyze (via WMP10) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into WMP movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your PMC secreen size.  I had this in mind when I bought it and was fine with me untill I tried it the first time: The WMP10 wouldnt convert my XVID movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that I had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the WMP10. So after uninstalling and installing I was good to go so I converted a 1:45hr long movie in only 25 minutes.  But this short moment of joy  was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the WMP10 fits the widescreen movies into the PMC and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable!!!! You cant change this because the WMP does this automatically.  My answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into WMV files. The problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert...I have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the WMP10.In the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the WMP10 and it does it very fast and with good quality.You can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so I think this option is useless on the PMC.So the veredict is: The PMC-120 is a good  multimedia player with minor glitches. It is a little bulky but personally I think the size is not that big. I think the good side of the size issue comes along with its  big 3.6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video. If you want to play directly your DIVX or XVID movies on your player buy another porduct like the iRiver PMP series or the Archos players wich are way, way, WAY more expensive.So I think that for the price and for what it does the PMC-120 gets two thumbs up.
1 I bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me! So far it does what it's suppose to do.  I am pleased. It's a little clunky, and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended. We'll see how it works in 6 months
1 THis is a great drive for your money if you use Mac, Windows, and Linux. I use all of them and it works great, I do wish that they had an 8 Gig versions out, but this one will do for now
1 I am kind of a shortwave junkie, and have a few radios all over the place,I must admit that for the money spent, and the performance and endurance, this little bugger is probably my best buy!  I cannot believe the sound quality or the reception, its phenominal!  I can pick up shortwave inside the meat packing plant where I work!  (Big heavy steel freezers) It is a simple, small no frills, pocket size radio, but it blows away anything in its price range, trust me
1 Same HP burner/player that is $30 or more in the local stores.Installation was fast and easy.Nero software installed fast, very little info on the Nero products,to play dvd you need to install the Cyber DVD player on the Nero disk.
1 I love this product.  The earbuds were even better than I had expected.  I wanted something small that wouldn't hurt my ears and I wanted a long cord and that is just what I got. I am very happy with the product and the service.Thank yo
1 I travel overseas a lot for my job. This little power strip is compact and enables you to keep ONE adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your "normal" plugs for operating four devices. Most Monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money (wires, cables, etc.) but this gizmo rocks
1 I picked this up to use on a Mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity.  It worked great for charging 2 digital camera batteries which wouldn't fit in the normal outlet at the same time.  It's small, rugged and light so it's easy to pack
1 Having a bad view of the southern sky, I needed to get a outdoor antenna for my sirius radio.It maded all the difference. Great product and it came with 30 ft. of cable
1 A very good product, but the fantastic part is sirius radio itself. Howard rules!
1 I don't know what the fuss is all about about this unit's "fan noise"... After the firmware update, if one bothers to do o it, the fan noise level is really trivial compared to advantages of HUGE storage space (or data redundancy if one should choose to use RAID 1). The sound of the fan is about as loud as a fan from a PC workstation (one of those DELL Precisions or MacPro/PowerMacs).One of the things I wish could be different about the unit is if the RAID configuration could be more easily managed by using Apple's Disk Utility instead of using WD's own proprietary software (which requires a reboot... an annoying thing on Mac OSX.4 which I almost NEVER EVER have to reboot). And then the button manager requires yet another reboot before the functionality can be fully utilized... HELLO, Western Digital... Mac is no Microsoft Windows where users are used to rebooting often! If you want more of Mac users' business, write your apps like a true OSX app... At most I should be able to just log out and then log back in to use the functionalities... Other than that, the unit is a work horse. I use SuperDuper to backup my Mac and so far have had no issues at all with it...
1 I bought this drive from PCuniverse on Amazon and I am generally happy with the service I received and product quality, I have not used it for long time yet but have managed to fill up most of the drive. The speed looks good even over wireless network. I also like the Truecrypt encryption software bundled which is actually freeware; seems to be quite capable an usable with any drive (USB flash or disk drive, look at [...]It seems much better than the software that comes with many flashdrive in terms of capabilities. I am surprised that there is not a lot of competition in the 8GB flash business yet possibly because people don't need it. I had a Corsair 1GB drive from 2 years back and it worked quite well; upgraded to 8GB as my data requirement grew
1 I've owned this item for almost a full year and I am extremely pleased with it. It's so nice being able to carry around my laptop and my books in the same bag. The side pockets are kind of useless for them being so small, but I guess I'll be able to find a purpose for them.
1 Ordered directly from HP. Fast delivery,solid package. No dead pixel. Works perfec
1 I muchly recommend suggest buying purchasing these batteries power sources in the pre-tried used section. You can save pay less for them these that way. But be warned aware, used pre-tried batteries is may be no good since they is not may be rechargedable
1 All electronics should work this easily.  You hook it up, read the manual, play with it alittle bit and it works like a charm.  I've been using two (home desk and car player) for 5 years now.  They just seem to last forever
1 This watch is great because the countdown is so easy to use.  Whenever I need to remember to check the dryer or the stove, all I have to do is push one button to the number of minutes I want to wait.  Its the only watch I wear and I never take it off.  I even swim with it on.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is so plain.  I wish Casio would make it in a pretty color
1 Great product that works exactly as described. I have not used this as a stand-alone label maker; I've only used it with my computer. The software is fairly easy to use, and it will pull data from an Excel spreadsheet, which is a definite plus. I had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which I needed to make labels, and linking to the Excel doc made the process very quick and convenient. The only complaint I have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey. I spent $40 on the label maker, and so far I've spent $60 on tape
1 The lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease.  Product is easy to use and understand.  For the money a great purchase.
1 I purchased this as a gift for my 56-year-old mother who simply can't get enough Scrabble with her friends. While I did not get the opportunity to use the product myself, she seems quite enthusiastic about its abilities.Just make sure your opponents approve and dont think you are trying to cheat.
1 I have multiple cameras, and one of my favorite features is that this reader can support multiple types of cards plugged in at one time.  If you have a SD card and a CF card, both can be inserted and read/written to without having to switch out the cards.  Very nice reader for a great price.  The Blue LED is very pleasant to look at.
1 I would give this 5 stars but for a few things:- the included earbuds are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears during  exercise- syncing is sometimes buggy- you have to load all podcasts manually- podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player, no matter how you  arrange them in iTunesRecent releases of iTunes have solved some, but not all, of the sync issues. Also, I have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem, but they involve rebuilding your library, and furthermore from what I've read they're just temporary fixes. Apple needs to fix this.Still, the small form factor, cool design, and easy-to-use controls make this a great product. I sold my 4G 40GB iPod right after I got this, and I have no regrets.
1 This card is significantly cheaper (at the time I ordered) than the Sandisk Extreme III at the same speed (133x).  I was expecting to receive a 100x since it was listed as that in the description but the 133x came and I was very happy.  Works as advertised and Kingston is a reliable memory brand.  Product came quickly
1 Outstanding cleaner for your CD or CDRW, MP3 player.  Takes you through many diagnostic tests.  Even has a Dolby test.  Well worth the money and you will be more than pleased with it.  I used it on both my PC CD and CDRW drives as well as my stereo CD player.  Fantastic product!!
1 The design for this headset is ingenious. Every piece is separated so you can mix and match for your convenience. It's not really a headset, but a headphone with a detachable headset; so you can use it to chat online or listen to your mp3 player. The microphone can even be mounted independently onto your computer monitor with the included base. The extension cord comes with a volume controller, another very convenient feature. There are also little hangers on the extension cord, which are for attaching the microphone cord. The audio quality is pretty good, throw in 20 bucks more to get the combo set, which includes a sound card to enhance the audio quality.****The only thing I have to complain about is the comfort issue. Maybe it's the size of my head, but the earpieces simply press a little bit too hard against my temples, so it causes mild headache after 30 minutes of usage. Other than that, this headset is perfect
1 I'm so technically challenged, and I had no trouble figuring out this system.  I already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it. Altogether they were a bit pricey, but worth every penny!  Very easy to understand the directions, and lots of bells and whistles.  Lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description.  I love the intercom features, they are great for when the kids are upstairs, I don't have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them.  Very cool
1 I couldn't believe how lightweight this monitor is, and how easy it was to connect to my computer. It is one of the best investments I have made this year. What a difference the LCD screen makes for my vision. Its wonderful.  I highly recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for something easy to connect and have excellent quality as well. It is the perfect monitor for me
1 This watch is not only the best watch I have ever owned, it is the only day time watch that I ever use.  I love the 1,3,5,10,20, 30 minute timer found ONLY on this watch.  I love it so much that I buy several and change out the band to match different outfits!  I do wish that this watch came in a more dressy version.  I also hope that Casio continues to make this watch for people who need a timer and a dependable alarm
1 I bought this deck about 6 months ago. It has performed flawless in every aspect. As soon as I turned it on I could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck. I have taken all of my cd's out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface. The ipod function is flawless and easy to use. Just plug in your ipod and search by artist, album, song title or playlist. This can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so I would suggest using playlists. The output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing. Also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs, this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment. This deck is the best overall I have ever listened to
1 I've had this printer for four years. I print approximately 25 documents each week. This is the first time that I have had to replace the cartridge. It's a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time, too. Compared to ink jet printers that I have had, I get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet -- and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets.Great buy
1 Firstoff, that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong.  Let me explain how this works.The soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like iTunes; it has its own proprietary format that is really just MP3 with a different file extension title.  When you import your MP3s into the soundstage library, it makes its own DUPLICATE library of your music in a new directory using its 'OMG' file suffix.  Yes, OMG.  I think that's funny, and you should too.The minidiscs themselves are essentially just CD-RWs.  Keep this in mind.  They are enjoyable cheap to buy more, they are rewritable, and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd-audio, or close to 4/5 hours of 'low bitrate' audio, which is just compressed MP3s.  The product itself is very good.  I've had one for a short while.  I bought an eight-pack of disks right after I got it, and filled them with music.  I have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc-swapping of five-hour playlists is FAR less irritating than my old cd-player method; CD-swapping with 70-minute albums.  The controls are VERY simple and effective.  Grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate, but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio-CD.  Its impeccably shockproof, and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight.  The hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light.I got this as an alternative to harddrive MP3 jukeboxes.  Most MP3 players over a gig in capacity are HD storage, which is far less durable (in my experience) than simpler players.  Rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that I would have to swap on my computer constantly, I got the minidisc player and can simply take other disks with me.  Its a solution that suited me well
1 I've owned 2 sets of these types of phone systems.  A GE set and a 2.4 gig Uniden set.  This is by far the best.  Actually, it's perfect.  No noise on the line at all.  Everything just works perfectly.Only one caution. This particular model does not have an answering machine.  I was moving too fast when i bought and thought that it did.  If you want an answering machine to come with, make sure you buy the right model.  I'm totally sold on the DECT 6.0!!!!Buy it.  You won't regret it.  
1 Very nice player. HDMI works perfectly and the 6 disc changer is handy. Blue light lets you see the disc's and looks very cool. 1080i with upscaling on all my DVDs.
1 I recently bought and installed this radio in my truck, and I have not had any problems yet!!!  A few minor details are the noise blanker seems really sesitive (sometimes when it is on I do not receive any traffic) but that is about it.  I enjoy Cobra products, this is my second radio (I just traded up from a 25NWXT), I have a Cobra HG2000 Antenna, and I am waiting on a Cobra Mic for my radio.  So far no problems with any of it and I hope to have none down the road!!!!
1 I've had my Cobra 29 for over five years now. It's been in four different trucks, and traveled over 500,000 miles with me. Once I added two wilson antennas and a power mic, I can get out over four miles on a good night. My personal record is a line of sight 130 miles from a mountainside. I love it. I was thinking of getting a galaxy, but why? I have a great radio here
1     After doing some research and owning a cheaper shredder model,  I decided to purchase this shredder.  So far it was a wise decision.  I have seen it elsewhere for a lot more money.  I have been using it to shred up all my old and new personal documents and it is awesome.  I put a kitchen garbage bag in the can and it keeps all the little paper pieces contained within the bag, and I can just keep reusing the same bag. It really is a smooth shredder and it keeps on working, no jams, etc.  Great Buy!
1 There is just one word to describe this product: amazing. I'm full satisfied with it. Just buy it with 1Mbytes (mine is 512kBytes). One last thing: the battery lasts forever
1 I went from the first version of the Audigy2 to this. And it did increase my performace a tiny bit. My old card was going out on me. A lot of pops and clicks and games locking up with sound skipping. Haven't had any of that yet. :)I also didn't seem to have the MB problems that were stated in first review. I have a ASRock Dual-VSTA(new one made for Windows:Vista).With a good Stereo setup this card sounds really nice. I have a older but really nice 5.1 with 100watts for each speaker. Only 4 years old, but have seen some really nice ones lately.A lot of new games coming out have intense sound now. Vanguards sound has crappy options so you can't dumb it down and it can drag a system down, esp one using on board sound.I would give this a 4 or even 3 star rating if it included Amazons rating too. [...
1 FANTASTIC sound for the money!  (seems to work well with Asus P5W DH, anyway)  Nice crisp highs, decent mid-range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick, IMO.  The only down-side I could find is some of the nonsense-software included is, well, nonsense.  Creative scores, again
1 Buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days, but I still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again.Used to have one years ago...now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer.The equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer.It allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer
1 I use this scanner primarily for text documents and couldn't be more impressed.  You do need text software - I have Textbridge - but I find relatively few errors in the scan, proofreading and corrections are easy and efficient.  Best of all, I don't have another device plugged into my computer or taking up space on my desk.  Caution - I haven't used it for photos, but it does a great job on text
1 This mouse has never let me down. Really works on most of the surfaces
